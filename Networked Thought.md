# Networked Thought

Networked thought refers to the practice of linking related ideas and notes within your PKM system. This approach fosters deeper insights and connections between concepts. Key practices include:

1. **Bi-directional Links**: Use bi-directional links to create connections between notes, allowing ideas to reference each other.
2. **Graph View**: Leverage tools that offer a graph view (e.g., Obsidian) to visualize connections between notes.
3. **Contextual Connections**: Regularly link new notes to existing ones to build a web of knowledge.
4. **Cross-referencing**: Use cross-referencing to explore relationships between different concepts.
