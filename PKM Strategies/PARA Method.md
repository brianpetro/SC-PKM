## Overview of PARA
PARA is a system for organizing information and tasks, developed by Tiago Forte. It stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

## Projects in PARA
Projects are short-term efforts with a specific goal. Each project should have clear action items and a deadline.

## Areas in PARA
Areas are long-term responsibilities, such as health or finance. These are ongoing and require consistent attention.

## Resources in PARA
Resources include reference material, knowledge, and tools. These are organized by topic.

## Archives in PARA
Archives contain information from completed projects or resources that are no longer actively used.
