## Overview of GTD
GTD is a time management method developed by David Allen. It focuses on capturing tasks and organizing them for effective execution.

## Capturing Tasks
In GTD, all tasks, ideas, and projects are captured in an external system, freeing mental space for execution.

## Organizing Tasks
Tasks are categorized by their next actions and context, such as calls to make or emails to send.

## Reviewing Tasks
Frequent reviews ensure tasks are up to date and that nothing falls through the cracks. Weekly reviews are a key part of the system.

## Executing Tasks
With a clear next action for each task, GTD allows for more efficient execution and reduced procrastination.
