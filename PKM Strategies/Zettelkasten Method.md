## Overview of Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a method of note-taking developed by Niklas Luhmann. It emphasizes creating small, interconnected notes called Zettels.

## History of Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten originated from Niklas Luhmann's work, where he used thousands of index cards to build an extensive knowledge system.

## Creating Zettels
- Write each idea on a separate Zettel.
- Ensure Zettels are focused and atomic.
- Link each Zettel to relevant topics.

## Linking Zettels
- Each Zettel should reference related notes to create a web of knowledge.
- Use bidirectional links for easier retrieval.

## Zettelkasten Tools
- Obsidian
- Roam Research

## Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten
Luhmann's Zettelkasten contained over 90,000 Zettels, showcasing the power of this system for synthesizing knowledge.
