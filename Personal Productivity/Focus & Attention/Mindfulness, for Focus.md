It’s not about having zero thoughts—it’s about noticing when you drift and gently coming back.

Ask yourself:
- When does my mind most often wander?
- What cues help me return to the task at hand?
- How can I use short mindfulness breaks during the day?

Mindfulness for focus is about training your attention to return to the present moment.
