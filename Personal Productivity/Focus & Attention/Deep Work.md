### Deep Work

- **Definition:** The practice of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, as popularized by Cal Newport.

It’s not just about getting more done—it’s about doing meaningful work at a higher level of quality.

Ask yourself:
- When do I feel most mentally sharp?
- What’s stealing focus during deep work sessions?
- What boundaries can I set to protect that time?

This note connects well with [[Single-tasking vs Multitasking (Context Switching)]], [[Managing Distractions]], and [[Flow State in Work]].

Deep work is focused, uninterrupted work that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit.
