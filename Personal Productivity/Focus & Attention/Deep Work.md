### Deep Work

It’s not just about getting more done—it’s about doing meaningful work at a higher level of quality.

Ask yourself:
- When do I feel most mentally sharp?
- What’s stealing focus during deep work sessions?
- What boundaries can I set to protect that time?

This note connects well with [[Single-tasking vs Multitasking (Context Switching)]], [[Managing Distractions]], and [[Flow State in Work]].

Deep work is focused, uninterrupted work that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit.

### Flow State in Work

- **Definition:** A mental state where a person is fully immersed in an activity, with a feeling of energized focus and enjoyment.
- **Characteristic:** Often occurs when the challenge of a task is balanced with one's skill level, leading to a loss of sense of time.
- **Benefit:** Working in flow can lead to high productivity and creativity, as well as personal satisfaction in the task.

It’s usually triggered by a mix of challenge and skill—just hard enough to stay engaged, but not overwhelming.

Ask yourself:
- What kind of tasks help me lose track of time?
- What conditions make flow more likely for me?
- How can I build more of that into my schedule?

This note pairs well with [[Deep Work]], [[Single-tasking vs Multitasking (Context Switching)]], and [[Mindfulness for Focus]] for increasing sustained engagement.

Flow state is a deeply focused mental state where you lose track of time and become fully immersed in a task.
