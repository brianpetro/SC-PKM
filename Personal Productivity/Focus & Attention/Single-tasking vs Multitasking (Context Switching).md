### Single-tasking vs Multitasking (Context Switching)

- **Definition:** Focusing on one task at a time (single-tasking) versus trying to handle multiple tasks at once (multitasking).
- **Key Point:** Multitasking often reduces efficiency due to context switching costs, whereas single-tasking can improve quality and speed.
- **Tip:** When possible, dedicate your attention to one task and group similar tasks together to minimize switching.

Multitasking often leads to context switching, which drains cognitive energy and reduces performance.

Ask yourself:
- When do I try to multitask most often?
- Whatâ€™s one task I can give my full attention to today?
- How do I feel after focused vs fragmented work sessions?

This note links well with [[Deep Work]], [[Flow State in Work]], and [[Time Blocking]] as strategies for reducing mental load.

Single-tasking vs multitasking is really a battle between depth and fragmentation.
