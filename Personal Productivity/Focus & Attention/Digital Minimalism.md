It’s not about ditching devices completely. It’s about being deliberate.

Ask yourself:
- Which digital tools actually support my focus?
- What apps or habits do I use on autopilot?
- Where could I carve out more tech-free space?

This connects well with [[Managing Distractions]], [[Mindfulness for Focus]], and [[Simplicity & Essentialism]] to explore how you create digital space that supports mental clarity.

Digital minimalism is about intentionally using technology to support your values—not distract from them.
