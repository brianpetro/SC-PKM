### The 80/20 Principle (Pareto)

- **Definition:** The principle that roughly 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes – a small portion of your efforts leads to most of your results.
- **Application:** Identify the few key tasks or activities that yield the highest benefit and focus more on those, rather than spreading effort evenly on everything.
- **Benefit:** By concentrating on the most impactful areas, you maximize results while minimizing wasted effort on low-value tasks.

**Key:** [[Task Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)]], [[Efficiency vs Effectiveness]], [[Time Affluence vs Money]]

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Too many tasks dilute impact because everything feels equally urgent.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Show me which 20% of inputs create 80% of outcomes so I can double down intentionally."
- **Dramatic question:** Will ruthless focus unlock leverage without neglecting critical responsibilities?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Effort stays busy yet under-recognized, leading to stagnation and burnout.
- **Prize if this works:** Concentrated effort creates visible wins and frees time for strategic thinking.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Rank projects weekly by revenue, retention, or learning impact and cut the bottom tier.
- **First principles:** Not all work is equal; feedback loops reveal leverage; opportunity cost is real.
- **Method boundary:** Limit new initiatives to ones that displace a lower-ranked task on the leverage board.
- **Tradeoffs:** Some supportive or administrative work slows, requiring negotiation with stakeholders.
- **Success criteria:** Top initiatives receive 60%+ of work hours and deliver measurable outcome gains.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Audit outputs → score leverage → focus time → measure results → recalibrate.
- **Key levers:** Weekly leverage dashboard, stakeholder alignment note, and time tracking tags.
- **Second-order wins:** Teams learn to surface high-leverage ideas and drop vanity work faster.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-focusing can ignore foundational maintenance; rotate audits to catch decay.
- **Measurable metrics:** Hours spent on top-tier tasks, outcome delta per cycle, and backlog reduction.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Pareto Leverage Sprint.
- **Minimal loop:** Identify leverage → schedule deep work → review output.
- **Checkable steps:** Run Friday leverage audit, block deep sessions, capture before/after metrics.
- **Stop conditions:** Rebalance if leverage ratio falls below 1.5x returns for two reviews.
- **Definition of done:** Highest leverage tasks prioritized, outcomes logged, low-impact work delegated or paused.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (spread thin), inciting incident (missed opportunity), rising action (leverage audit), climax (focused sprint), resolution (outsized result).
- **Single visual metaphor:** Spotlight illuminating the few blocks that support a whole structure.
- **High-impact visuals:** Bar chart comparing effort vs results, calendar showing deep-work anchors.
- **Dramatization moments:** Decision to cancel a low-yield meeting and redirect to a leverage project.
- **Measured call to action:** Prompt viewers to tag their next week’s tasks by leverage and share the biggest cut.
