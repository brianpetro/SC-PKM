### Decision Fatigue

- **Definition:** The deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision making.
- **Effect:** As decision fatigue sets in, one may make impulsive choices or avoid decisions entirely; thus, important decisions are best made when fresh.
- **Tip:** Simplify choices by establishing routines (e.g., meal prepping to avoid daily food decisions) and tackle crucial decisions early in the day.

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Endless micro-decisions drain focus before strategic work begins.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me script routine choices so my best attention is saved for judgment calls."
- **Dramatic question:** Can a pre-committed decision ladder keep high-stakes calls sharp after lunch?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Quality drops, procrastination spikes, and stakeholders lose trust in my recommendations.
- **Prize if this works:** Morning clarity, faster execution, and energy left for creative problem-solving.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Batch recurring decisions into templates reviewed weekly.
- **First principles:** Cognitive bandwidth is finite; automation beats willpower; default to "decide once, execute often."
- **Method boundary:** Only allow three discretionary choices before noon; everything else follows pre-built scripts.
- **Tradeoffs:** Less spontaneity today for predictable high-quality calls when they matter.
- **Success criteria:** 80% of routine choices reference a template and end-of-day energy stays at 3/5 or higher.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Audit decision points → categorize → template → schedule → review outcomes.
- **Key levers:** Morning checklist, meal/workout presets, automated prioritization prompts.
- **Second-order wins:** More emotional resilience and deeper focus on design or strategy work.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-automation can ignore new context; weekly review note captures exceptions.
- **Measurable metrics:** Number of ad-hoc decisions logged, afternoon task completion rate, self-rated clarity.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Autopilot Decision Stack.
- **Minimal loop:** Capture decision → assign template → execute → log variance.
- **Checkable steps:** Monday preset refresh, daily decision log, Friday variance review, template update.
- **Agency metrics:** % of day on autopilot scripts, variance count, clarity score in Smart Vault daily note.
- **Stop conditions:** If variance spikes three days in a row, pause automation and re-segment decisions.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (decision overload), inciting incident (botched call late afternoon), progressive complications (mounting choices), climax (deploy templates), resolution (evening energy left).
- **First-person line:** "By noon my brain was mush—until I stopped deciding the same things twice."
- **Single visual metaphor:** A stack of labeled toggles flipping automatically as the day progresses.
- **High-impact visuals:** Screen capture of preset checklist, timeline showing decision load drop, Smart Vault log snippet.
- **Measured call to action:** Challenge viewers to script their top five repetitive decisions and log the clarity gain.
