### Email Management Strategies

- **Definition:** Techniques to handle incoming email efficiently so it doesn’t become overwhelming.
- **Strategy:** This may include using filters and folders, setting designated email times, and writing concise responses to maintain control over your inbox.
- **Benefit:** Good email management saves time and reduces stress by preventing an overflowing inbox from derailing your focus.

**Key:** [[Inbox Zero]], [[Decision Fatigue]], [[Automation for Repetitive Tasks]]

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Inbox overload keeps stealing focus from meaningful work.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me tame email so it serves decisions instead of dictating my day."
- **Dramatic question:** Can a system shrink inbox chaos without missing critical messages?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Important opportunities get buried while stress and context switching spike.
- **Prize if this works:** A predictable inbox rhythm that supports quick triage and deeper work blocks.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Process email in two scheduled blocks daily and keep inbox zero by close of day.
- **First principles:** Batch similar tasks; automate whenever rules exist; decision latency compounds.
- **Method boundary:** Every email is tagged delete, delegate, defer, or do within two minutes.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slightly slower response times outside processing windows but higher-quality replies.
- **Success criteria:** Inbox ends under 10 messages daily with zero aging beyond 48 hours.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Schedule processing → apply 4D triage → route tasks → document outcomes → review metrics.
- **Key levers:** Filter rules, templated responses, and a capture note for deferred actions.
- **Second-order wins:** Mental bandwidth returns for strategic projects and decision fatigue drops.
- **Second-order risks:** Automation rules could hide crucial threads; weekly audits catch misfiles.
- **Measurable metrics:** Average inbox count at day-end, response SLA, number of templated replies used.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Two-Block Inbox Loop.
- **Minimal loop:** Process block → triage with 4Ds → log follow-ups.
- **Checkable steps:** Morning inbox sweep, afternoon review, update task manager, archive cleared messages.
- **Stop conditions:** Reassess if average inbox exceeds 25 for three consecutive days.
- **Definition of done:** Inbox cleared, tasks captured, no critical email unanswered beyond agreed SLA.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (chaotic inbox), inciting incident (missed email), rising action (rule building), climax (first inbox zero), resolution (sustained calm).
- **Single visual metaphor:** Conveyor belt sorting messages into labeled bins.
- **High-impact visuals:** Screen capture of filter setup, before/after inbox dashboard, snippet of templated replies.
- **Dramatization moments:** Time-lapse of two processing blocks contrasted with uninterrupted deep work.
- **Measured call to action:** Challenge viewers to schedule their own two-block experiment and share results in Smart Vault.
