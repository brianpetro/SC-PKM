## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Work hours sprawl into evenings and weekends, leaving no recovery window.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me create guardrails so I can be fully present at work *and* at home without burning out."
- **Dramatic question:** Can deliberate boundaries protect personal energy without sabotaging career momentum?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Chronic exhaustion erodes health, relationships, and performance reviews.
- **Prize if this works:** Predictable rhythms where rest fuels better work and family time feels guilt-free.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Commit to fixed daily shutdown and weekend offline blocks regardless of project pressure.
- **First principles:** Rest is a productivity multiplier; clarity beats volume; commitments must match available energy.
- **Method boundary:** Limit work tasks to three priority outcomes per day plus one overflow slot for emergencies.
- **Tradeoffs:** Short-term responsiveness drops, but focus sessions gain depth and signal respect for personal time.
- **Success criteria:** Weekly review confirms boundaries held 80% of the time and energy scores trend upward.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Define boundaries → communicate them → enforce routines → monitor energy → adjust load.
- **Key levers:** Shared calendar blocks, end-of-day shutdown ritual, and Sunday planning note.
- **Second-order wins:** Stronger relationships and creative recharge boost problem-solving at work.
- **Second-order risks:** Unmanaged escalations could force boundary breaks; escalation protocol mitigates.
- **Measurable metrics:** Daily shutdown compliance, sleep hours, and subjective energy rating in weekly note.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Boundary-Backed Workweek.
- **Minimal loop:** Plan priorities → execute within boundary → log wins and slips.
- **Checkable steps:** Morning prioritization, calendar holds, shutdown checklist, energy reflection.
- **Stop conditions:** Pause and renegotiate if two consecutive weeks miss boundaries by more than 40%.
- **Definition of done:** Boundaries honored, energy above 3/5, and next week scheduled with buffer slots.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (overload), inciting incident (missed family moment), progressive complications (boundary tests), climax (asserted shutdown), resolution (rested presence).
- **Single visual metaphor:** Hourglass split into work and life chambers with a controllable valve.
- **High-impact visuals:** Calendar screenshot of blocked evenings, journal snippets showing energy rebound.
- **Dramatization moments:** Scenes of closing the laptop, silencing notifications, and embracing personal rituals.
- **Measured call to action:** Invite viewers to schedule their own shutdown ritual and log the first week inside Smart Vault.
