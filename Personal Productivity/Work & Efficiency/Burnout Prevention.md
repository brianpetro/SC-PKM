## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Continuous hustle leaves no recovery, making each week harder than the last.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Show me how to pace intensity so I can sustain high performance without collapsing."
- **Dramatic question:** Can proactive rest plans beat creeping exhaustion before it derails projects?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Health declines, creative spark fades, and deadlines slip from chronic fatigue.
- **Prize if this works:** Sustainable momentum, reliable focus, and confidence in long-term capacity.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Lock in a 3:1 work-to-recovery ratio and protect it like a key deliverable.
- **First principles:** Energy is the limiting resource; rest is productive; warning signals deserve immediate response.
- **Method boundary:** Cap weekly work blocks at 45 focused hours with scheduled active recovery sessions.
- **Tradeoffs:** Fewer ad-hoc heroics but steadier execution and fewer emergencies created by burnout.
- **Success criteria:** Weekly reflection shows energy at or above baseline and zero unchecked burnout markers.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Identify stressors → schedule buffers → execute recovery rituals → monitor biomarkers.
- **Key levers:** Sleep tracking, protected deep-work windows, midweek reset block, accountability buddy.
- **Second-order wins:** Better mood improves team dynamics and creative ideation.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-scheduling rest can feel restrictive; monthly review adjusts ratios based on seasonality.
- **Measurable metrics:** HRV or sleep score trend, weekly energy rating, count of boundary violations.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Sustainable Output Rhythm.
- **Minimal loop:** Plan workload → insert recovery → execute → reflect on signals.
- **Checkable steps:** Sunday planning, daily energy check-in, midweek decompression ritual, Friday review.
- **Agency metrics:** Recovery adherence %, number of early warning signals captured, average energy score.
- **Stop conditions:** If two consecutive weeks dip below energy baseline, trigger recovery sprint and renegotiate commitments.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (quiet exhaustion), inciting incident (missed milestone), progressive complications (ignored signals), climax (schedule reset), resolution (energized return).
- **First-person line:** "I stopped waiting for burnout to force a break and started booking rest like revenue."
- **Single visual metaphor:** Battery icon cycling between charge and discharge with planned recharge points.
- **High-impact visuals:** Calendar view of recovery blocks, sleep dashboard screenshot, journal excerpt marking renewed focus.
- **Measured call to action:** Invite viewers to audit their last month for burnout signals and schedule a recovery sprint.
