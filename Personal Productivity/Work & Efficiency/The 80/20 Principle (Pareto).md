### The 80/20 Principle (Pareto)

- **Definition:** The principle that roughly 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes â€“ a small portion of your efforts leads to most of your results.
- **Application:** Identify the few key tasks or activities that yield the highest benefit and focus more on those, rather than spreading effort evenly on everything.
- **Benefit:** By concentrating on the most impactful areas, you maximize results while minimizing wasted effort on low-value tasks.

**Key:** [[Task Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)]], [[Efficiency vs Effectiveness]], [[Time Affluence vs Money]]
