### Efficiency vs Effectiveness

- **Definition:** Efficiency is about doing tasks quickly with minimal waste, while effectiveness is about doing the right tasks to achieve a desired outcome.
- **Balance:** Ideally, one should be effective first (focusing on what truly matters) and then become efficient at those tasks.
- **Example:** You can efficiently answer lots of emails (efficient but not necessarily effective if those emails are low priority). Being effective means spending time on high-impact work first.

**Key:** [[The 80-20 Principle (Pareto)]], [[Daily Planning & Prioritization]], [[Decision Fatigue]]

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Being busy all day without moving the needle leaves frustration and fatigue.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me choose the right work before optimizing how fast I do it."
- **Dramatic question:** Can prioritizing effectiveness before efficiency deliver better outcomes without wasting motion?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Teams ship polished but irrelevant work and lose trust with stakeholders.
- **Prize if this works:** High-value goals receive focus, and process improvements amplify impact instead of noise.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Start every planning session by defining the desired outcome and success metric before assigning tasks.
- **First principles:** Effectiveness answers "should we?" before "how fast?"; quality outcomes justify optimization.
- **Method boundary:** No workflow automation unless the underlying objective has validated impact.
- **Tradeoffs:** Momentum on low-value tasks slows, requiring patience and stakeholder communication.
- **Success criteria:** Weekly review shows top objectives progressing and efficiency gains tied to measurable outcomes.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Clarify objective → choose leverage tasks → execute → measure → optimize process.
- **Key levers:** Outcome briefs, success metric dashboards, and retrospective notes capturing lessons.
- **Second-order wins:** Culture shifts from activity reporting to results storytelling, enabling smarter automation.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-analysis may delay delivery; use timeboxes to keep momentum.
- **Measurable metrics:** Ratio of goal metrics hit vs hours spent, number of optimizations linked to validated wins.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Outcome-First Optimization.
- **Minimal loop:** Define outcome → align tasks → execute → refine process.
- **Checkable steps:** Draft outcome brief, select leverage tasks, run execution sprint, document learnings.
- **Stop conditions:** Reevaluate if two cycles show improved speed without impact movement.
- **Definition of done:** Outcome metric moves, supporting tasks documented, and future optimizations prioritized.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (busy but stalled), inciting incident (missed target), rising action (outcome-first shift), climax (impactful delivery), resolution (optimized workflow).
- **Single visual metaphor:** Archery target where arrows align before being fired rapidly.
- **High-impact visuals:** Split diagram of busywork vs impact workflow, metric dashboard trending after shift.
- **Dramatization moments:** Workshop scene rewriting a task list into outcome statements before automating.
- **Measured call to action:** Ask viewers to audit one project for effectiveness first and log the resulting metric change.
