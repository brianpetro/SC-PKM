### Efficiency vs Effectiveness

- **Definition:** Efficiency is about doing tasks quickly with minimal waste, while effectiveness is about doing the right tasks to achieve a desired outcome.
- **Balance:** Ideally, one should be effective first (focusing on what truly matters) and then become efficient at those tasks.
- **Example:** You can efficiently answer lots of emails (efficient but not necessarily effective if those emails are low priority). Being effective means spending time on high-impact work first.
