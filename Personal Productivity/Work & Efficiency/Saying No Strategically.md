### Saying No Strategically

- **Definition:** The practice of declining requests or opportunities that are not aligned with your priorities or would overextend you.
- **Importance:** Saying no protects your time and energy, allowing you to focus on commitments that truly matter.
- **Tip:** Be polite but firm; you can offer an alternative or simply state you don't have the capacity, rather than giving an uncertain yes that leads to stress.
