### Rituals vs Routines

- **Definition:** Rituals are meaningful practices done with intention, while routines are habitual actions often done automatically.
- **Perspective:** Turning important routines into rituals (by doing them mindfully or attaching personal meaning) can increase enjoyment and consistency.
- **Example:** Treating your morning coffee brewing as a quiet ritual can make it a mindful practice, rather than just an automatic routine.
