### Habit Stacking

- **Definition:** A strategy where you attach a new habit to an existing habit, using the established habit as a cue for the new one.
- **Benefit:** By linking behaviors, it becomes easier to remember and maintain the new habit since it's piggybacking on an existing routine.
- **Example:** After pouring your morning coffee (existing habit), you meditate for 5 minutes (new habit). The coffee routine reminds you to meditate.
