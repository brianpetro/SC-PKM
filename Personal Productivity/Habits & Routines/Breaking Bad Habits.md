### Breaking Bad Habits

- **Definition:** The process of identifying and eliminating habits that negatively impact your life or goals.
- **Strategy:** Replace a bad habit with a healthier behavior that satisfies a similar need (e.g., go for a walk instead of smoking when stressed).
- **Tip:** Change your environment to remove cues for the bad habit and use accountability or tracking to monitor progress. Leverage the habit loop: interrupt the cue or swap the routine.
