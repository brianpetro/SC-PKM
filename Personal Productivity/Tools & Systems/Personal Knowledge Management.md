### Personal Knowledge Management

- **Definition:** A system for collecting, organizing, and retrieving personal information and knowledge (often referred to as building a "second brain").
- **Goal:** To have a repository of notes and resources that helps you remember and make connections between ideas over time.
- **Tip:** Regularly review and curate your notes, and use consistent tagging or linking (like in a Zettelkasten system) for easy navigation.

**Key:** [[Zettelkasten Note-Taking]], [[Note-Taking Techniques]], [[Personal Productivity/Tools & Systems/Mind Mapping]]

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Useful insights vanish because they're not stored in a trusted system.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me capture and retrieve ideas so they compound across projects."
- **Dramatic question:** Can a personal knowledge base become the default partner for planning and creation?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Repeated research, missed opportunities, and confidence gaps in decision-making.
- **Prize if this works:** A second brain that surfaces answers, narratives, and prompts instantly.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Anchor every project to a PKM hub with GTD-aligned horizons.
- **First principles:** Capture everything once, process weekly, link context to outcomes, keep friction low.
- **Method boundary:** All notes require tags for horizon + status and at least one outcome link.
- **Tradeoffs:** More upfront processing, but future briefs and scripts assemble in minutes.
- **Success criteria:** Weekly review clears inboxes, and active projects reference PKM materials at least twice.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Capture → clarify → organize by horizon → reflect → engage outputs.
- **Key levers:** Smart Vault dashboards, spaced review reminders, contextual templates, GPT-assisted summaries.
- **Second-order wins:** Faster onboarding of collaborators, consistent messaging, and accelerated learning loops.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-curation slows progress; mitigate with time-boxed processing sessions.
- **Measurable metrics:** Inbox size over time, retrieval success rate, number of insights reused per deliverable.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Horizon-Aligned Second Brain.
- **Minimal loop:** Capture inputs → process into structure → review → deploy insights.
- **Checkable steps:** Daily capture sweep, weekly horizon review, monthly archive, quarterly pruning.
- **Agency metrics:** % of notes with horizon tags, retrieval time for key concepts, reuse count per quarter.
- **Stop conditions:** If retrieval exceeds five minutes or reuse drops below target, retool taxonomy and templates.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (info chaos), inciting incident (missed fact), progressive complications (organizing attempts), climax (PKM hub launch), resolution (ideas instantly available).
- **First-person line:** "When every idea had a home, shipping became the easy part."
- **Single visual metaphor:** A library with dynamic shelves that rearrange by horizon.
- **High-impact visuals:** Dashboard screenshot, capture-to-review flow diagram, before/after retrieval timer.
- **Measured call to action:** Ask viewers to map one project to horizons and link three supporting notes today.
