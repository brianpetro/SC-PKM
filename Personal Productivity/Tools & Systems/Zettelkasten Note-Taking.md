### Zettelkasten Note-Taking

- **Definition:** A note-taking method using index cards or digital notes, where each note is assigned an ID and linked to other notes to form a network of ideas.
- **Notable:** Developed by Niklas Luhmann, who used it to produce a large body of work by tracing connections between notes.
- **Benefit:** Encourages breaking ideas into small, atomic notes and fosters discovering non-obvious connections, enhancing creativity and understanding.

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Insights scatter across tools, making it hard to reuse thinking.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me turn loose notes into a network that feeds future projects."
- **Dramatic question:** Can atomic linking transform raw snippets into publish-ready arguments?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Valuable ideas stay buried, slowing content creation and product decisions.
- **Prize if this works:** A searchable lattice that sparks fresh combinations on demand.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Commit to writing every idea as an atomic card with explicit links.
- **First principles:** Connection beats collection; IDs anchor permanence; context lives in backlinks.
- **Method boundary:** Maximum one idea per note with UID + tags + at least two outbound links.
- **Tradeoffs:** More up-front friction but exponential reuse when drafting or designing.
- **Success criteria:** Weekly review surfaces at least three linked notes that inform active work.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Capture idea → assign UID → link to existing concepts → resurface via queries → apply.
- **Key levers:** Smart Vault templates, daily capture ritual, periodic refactoring sessions.
- **Second-order wins:** Better long-form writing, faster onboarding for collaborators, resilient memory.
- **Second-order risks:** Over-linking noise; solved by pruning sessions and guardrails on tag vocab.
- **Measurable metrics:** New notes per week, average outbound links per card, reuse count in deliverables.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Linked Thought Engine.
- **Minimal loop:** Capture → link → revisit → integrate.
- **Checkable steps:** Daily inbox processing, UID assignment, link validation, weekly resurfacing query, monthly pruning.
- **Agency metrics:** % of notes with two+ links, number of resurfaced cards feeding outputs, time to assemble outline.
- **Stop conditions:** If notes accumulate without links for two weeks, pause capture and refactor backlog.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (idea graveyard), inciting incident (missed connection), progressive complications (linking practice), climax (note sparks new piece), resolution (living knowledge web).
- **Pattern interrupt:** Show before/after of an unlinked note transformed into a connected card.
- **Single visual metaphor:** Constellation map with nodes lighting up as links form.
- **High-impact visuals:** Smart Vault note template screenshot, graph view animation, outline built from linked cards.
- **Measured call to action:** Prompt viewers to convert one existing note into an atomic card and link it twice.
