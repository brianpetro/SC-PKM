### Mind Mapping

- **Definition:** A visual diagram that organizes information hierarchically around a central idea, using branches for related subtopics.
- **Use Case:** Useful for brainstorming, planning, or learning new information because it mirrors the brain's associative thinking process.
- **Tip:** Start with a central concept, then freely jot down connected ideas, drawing lines to connect them to the central node or other related nodes, forming a map.
