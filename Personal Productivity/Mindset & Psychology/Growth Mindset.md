### Growth Mindset

- **Definition:** The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort, learning, and persistence (as opposed to a fixed mindset).
- **Impact:** Encourages embracing challenges, learning from criticism, and persisting in the face of setbacks because you see them as opportunities to grow.
- **Tip:** Practice reframing failures as learning experiences and use the word "yet" (e.g., "I can't do this yet") to remind yourself that skills improve over time.
