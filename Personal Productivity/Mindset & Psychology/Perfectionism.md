### Perfectionism

- **Definition:** A disposition to regard anything short of perfect as unacceptable, often leading to excessive self-criticism and procrastination.
- **Pitfall:** Perfectionism can cause delays in completing work and stress due to unrealistically high standards.
- **Strategy:** Set reasonable standards and deadlines; focus on progress over perfection and celebrate completed tasks even if not 100% perfect.
