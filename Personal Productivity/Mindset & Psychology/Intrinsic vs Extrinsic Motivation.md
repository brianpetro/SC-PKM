### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

- **Definition:** Intrinsic motivation comes from internal satisfaction or interest in the task itself, whereas extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards or pressures.
- **Observation:** Intrinsic motivation often leads to greater enjoyment and persistence, while extrinsic can be useful for tasks that are necessary but not inherently interesting.
- **Application:** To boost motivation, try to connect tasks to your personal values or find aspects of the work you enjoy, rather than relying solely on rewards or fear of punishment.
