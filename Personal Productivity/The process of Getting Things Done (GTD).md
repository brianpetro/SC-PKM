## WHY
To implement and master the Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity system


## WDLL
- All tasks and commitments are captured in a trusted system
- Inbox is regularly processed and emptied
- Tasks are organized into appropriate categories and contexts
- Regular reviews are conducted to keep the system up-to-date
- Increased productivity and reduced stress due to clear mind


## planning
- Capturing all inputs and ideas in a collection tool
- Processing the inbox and making decisions about each item
- Organizing tasks into projects, next actions, and reference materials
- Reviewing lists and updating them regularly
- Engaging in tasks based on context, time available, and energy levels


## next decisions
- Choosing the right tools for capturing and organizing tasks
- Committing to regular processing and review schedules
- Defining clear next actions for all projects
- Balancing immediate tasks with long-term goals and projects
- Adapting the system to fit personal work style and needs


## next actions
- Set up a reliable capture system (digital or physical)
- Conduct an initial "mind sweep" to capture all open loops
- Establish a regular time for daily and weekly reviews
- Create project lists and next action lists
- Practice the two-minute rule for quick tasks

## HOW
- **Felt problem:**
  - Too many open loops create anxiety and cause commitments to fall through the cracks.
- **Job-to-be-done:**
  - "I need a trusted system that captures every task so I can decide what matters next."
- **Dramatic question:**
  - Can I trust myself to execute on what I promise without mental overload?
- **Current pain:**
  - Context switching and ad-hoc lists lead to missed follow-ups and late deliverables.
- **Stakes if unchanged:**
  - Burnout, lost credibility with collaborators, and stalled strategic projects.
- **Prize if this works:**
  - Calm focus with reliable progress on both immediate and horizon goals.
- **Relatable friction story:**
  - Weekly reviews keep slipping because inboxes never feel "clean" enough to start.
- **Before snapshot:**
  - Notes, emails, and sticky reminders pile up with no single source of truth.
- **After snapshot:**
  - Each idea lands in an inbox, is clarified into next actions, and lives in the right list.
- **GTD horizon link:**
  - Anchors Horizons 1–3 by clarifying next actions, projects, and areas.
- **Hook to common struggle:**
  - Everyone has more commitments than working memory can hold.
- **One-sentence version:**
  - A capture-to-review habit that keeps every commitment actionable and trusted.

## Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:**
  - Commit to processing every input through capture → clarify → organize → reflect → engage.
- **First principles:**
  - Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them; trusted lists drive calm control.
- **Method boundary:**
  - Stick to GTD's five steps before layering automations or advanced tooling.
- **Key definitions:**
  - Next action = visible physical step; project = outcome needing >1 action.
- **Key term boundaries:**
  - Someday/Maybe is not a parking lot for active projects; calendar holds time-specific commitments only.
- **Concrete examples:**
  - Turn "plan launch" into "Draft launch brief outline" and assign to the Projects list.
- **Tradeoffs:**
  - Time invested in weekly reviews trades off with reactive work but prevents firefighting.
- **Anti-goals:**
  - Avoid over-customizing tools before mastering the base loop.
- **Required inputs:**
  - Capture tools, project list, next action lists, calendar, and review cadence.
- **Constraints:**
  - Reviews must happen even during peak workload weeks to keep trust intact.
- **Beliefs that justify the choice:**
  - Clarity reduces stress more than speed; disciplined reflection creates reliable execution.
- **Non-fit cases:**
  - Teams that require centralized work management without personal autonomy.
- **GTD horizon link:**
  - Weekly review bridges Horizons 2–3 by aligning projects with area commitments.
- **Success criteria:**
  - Inbox zero weekly, current project list, and confidence answering "What should I do now?"

## Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:**
  - Capture everything → clarify meaning → organize into lists → review regularly → execute with focus.
- **Key levers:**
  - Daily inbox processing and the non-negotiable weekly review.
- **Second-order wins:**
  - Clearer prioritization conversations and faster onboarding for collaborators.
- **Second-order risks:**
  - Over-optimization leads to procrastination on actual doing.
- **Third-order externalities:**
  - Teams adopt shared language for commitments, improving cross-functional trust.
- **Debts or maintenance costs:**
  - Backlog of stale tasks erodes trust if reviews slip for more than two weeks.
- **Contrasting failed paths:**
  - Relying on memory or scattered apps without a unifying workflow.
- **Ladder of abstraction:**
  - From daily task to project to area to horizon-level purpose.
- **Early signals:**
  - Inbox counts drop, calendar time blocks for reviews hold, and next actions start with verbs.
- **Measurable metrics:**
  - Weekly review completion rate, number of clarified next actions, and percent of projects with current outcomes.
- **Falsifiable assumptions:**
  - If weekly reviews happen but stress remains high, the capture or clarify steps are incomplete.
- **GTD bridge:**
  - Links Horizon 1 execution to Horizon 5 purpose by maintaining trusted commitments.

## Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:**
  - The GTD Capture-to-Action Loop.
- **Minimal loop:**
  - Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage once per day.
- **Checkable steps:**
  - Empty inboxes, assign contexts, confirm next action verbs, review projects, choose work by context/time/energy.
- **Needed templates:**
  - Inbox note, project brief outline, weekly review checklist, and context-tagged task lists.
- **Local-first instructions:**
  - Store notes in Obsidian vault with daily capture note and dataview lists for contexts.
- **File-over-app notes:**
  - Use markdown tasks with YAML metadata to keep data portable.
- **Agency metrics:**
  - Percentage of commitments captured within 24 hours and weekly review adherence.
- **Stop conditions:**
  - Pause capture review when backlog exceeds capacity and renegotiate commitments.
- **Definition of done:**
  - Every open loop clarified, next actions organized, and calendar/blockers reviewed for the week.
- **Reuse paths across tools:**
  - Sync markdown tasks with task manager exports if collaboration requires shared tooling.
- **Community reciprocity steps:**
  - Share weekly review prompts and improvements with Smart Vault contributors.
- **Credits and sources:**
  - David Allen's GTD, Smart Connections workflow demos, and Smart Vault review scripts.
- **GTD link:**
  - References Smart Vault GTD horizons directory for horizon-specific notes.

## Visual and narrative execution plan
