### Daily Planning & Prioritization

- **Definition:** The practice of organizing your tasks each day and deciding which ones are most important to focus on.
- **Benefit:** By deliberately planning your day, you increase productivity and ensure urgent and important tasks are addressed in a timely manner.
- **Tip:** Each morning (or the night before), list the top 3 tasks you need to accomplish that day to maintain focus on priorities.

**Key:** [[Task Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)]], [[Weekly Review Process]], [[Time Blocking]]


It’s where strategy becomes motion.

Ask yourself:
- What are today’s 1–3 most important outcomes?
- What can I delay, delegate, or delete?
- When do I do my best work—and am I protecting that time?

This note links well with [[Time Blocking]], [[Weekly Review Process]], and [[SMART Goals]].

Daily planning helps translate long-term goals into clear actions.
