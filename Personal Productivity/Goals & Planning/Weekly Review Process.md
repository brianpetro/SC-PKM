### Weekly Review Process

- **Definition:** A regular end-of-week habit of reviewing tasks completed, pending items, and upcoming priorities.
- **Benefit:** Provides a consistent opportunity to reflect on progress, clean up your task system, and prepare for the week ahead.
- **Tip:** Set aside a fixed time (e.g., Friday afternoon or Sunday evening) to go through your to-do list, calendar, and notes for a thorough review.

**Key:** [[Getting Things Done (GTD)]], [[Life Audit]], [[Personal Growth Plan]]


It helps you notice what’s working, where you’re drifting, and what needs adjustment.

Ask yourself:
- What worked well this week?
- What pulled me off track—and why?
- What needs my focus next week?

This note pairs well with [[Goal Tracking & Accountability]], [[Daily Planning & Prioritization]], and [[Life Vision & Goal Planning]].

The weekly review process keeps your plans grounded in reality.
