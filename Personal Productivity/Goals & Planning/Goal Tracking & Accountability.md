### Goal Tracking & Accountability

- **Definition:** Monitoring your progress towards goals and using methods (like check-ins or accountability partners) to stay on track.
- **Benefit:** Regular tracking keeps you aware of how you're doing relative to your plan, and accountability increases commitment and follow-through.
- **Tip:** Use tools like habit trackers or progress charts, and consider sharing your goals with a friend or coach who can hold you accountable.

**Key:** [[SMART Goals]], [[OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)]], [[Habit Tracking]]


The key isn’t just tracking—it’s reflecting on what’s working, what’s not, and what’s next.

Ask yourself:
- Am I checking off tasks or making real progress?
- What patterns show up in what I track?
- Who can I share this with to stay accountable?

This note links well with [[SMART Goals]], [[OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)]], and [[Weekly Review Process]].

Goal tracking helps turn intention into follow-through.
