### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

- **Definition:** A goal-setting methodology where high-level Objectives are defined along with Key Results that measure progress toward each objective.
- **Usage:** Common in organizations to align team efforts, but can be adapted personally to maintain focus on outcomes rather than just tasks.
- **Benefit:** Keeps your goals ambitious yet trackable, and ensures every Key Result has a clear indicator of success.

**Key:** [[SMART Goals]], [[Goal Tracking & Accountability]], [[Life Vision & Goal Planning]]


They work best when they're specific, time-bound, and ambitious—but still realistic.

Ask yourself:
- What’s the objective I’m focused on this quarter?
- What key results would prove progress?
- Is this pushing me to grow without becoming overwhelming?

This note links well with [[SMART Goals]], [[Goal Tracking & Accountability]], and [[Weekly Review Process]].

OKRs help align your big-picture goals with measurable results.
