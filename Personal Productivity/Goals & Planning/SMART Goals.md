### SMART Goals

- **Definition:** A framework for goal setting to ensure goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
- **Benefit:** Clarifies what exactly you want to achieve and how you'll measure success, making it more likely you'll reach the goal.
- **Tip:** Write down your goals in SMART format and revisit them regularly to track progress and make adjustments if needed.

**Key:** [[OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)]], [[Goal Tracking & Accountability]], [[Life Vision & Goal Planning]]


They turn vague intentions into clear commitments.

Ask yourself:
- Is this goal crystal clear and motivating?
- How will I track progress or know itâ€™s done?
- Is the timeline realistic and grounded in current priorities?

This note connects well with [[OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)]], [[Goal Tracking & Accountability]], and [[Daily Planning & Prioritization]].

SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
