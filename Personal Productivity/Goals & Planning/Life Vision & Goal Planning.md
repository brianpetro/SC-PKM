### Life Vision & Goal Planning

- **Definition:** Establishing a long-term vision for your life or career and then setting structured goals to achieve that vision.
- **Benefit:** A clear vision provides direction, while goal planning breaks down that vision into actionable steps and milestones.
- **Tip:** Regularly revisit your vision and goals, ensuring they still resonate with your values, and adjust them as life circumstances change.

**Key:** [[SMART Goals]], [[OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)]], [[Personal Mission Statement]]


Your goals should emerge from what truly matters to you—not just what’s urgent or expected.

Ask yourself:
- What do I want to be moving toward in five years?
- What kind of person do I want to become in that process?
- What goals align with that vision this month?

This note pairs well with [[Personal Mission Statement]], [[SMART Goals]], and [[Weekly Review Process]].

A clear life vision makes short-term goals more meaningful.
