### Life Vision & Goal Planning

- **Definition:** Establishing a long-term vision for your life or career and then setting structured goals to achieve that vision.
### Benefits and Tips
- **Benefit:** A clear vision provides direction, while goal planning breaks down that vision into actionable steps and milestones.
- **Tip:** Regularly revisit your vision and goals, ensuring they still resonate with your values, and adjust them as life circumstances change.

Your goals should emerge from what truly matters to you—not just what’s urgent or expected.

Ask yourself:
- What do I want to be moving toward in five years?
- What kind of person do I want to become in that process?
- What goals align with that vision this month?

A clear life vision makes short-term goals more meaningful.
