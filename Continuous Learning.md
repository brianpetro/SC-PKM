# Continuous Learning

PKM supports continuous learning by providing a structured approach to capturing, organizing, and applying knowledge. This ensures that learning is a lifelong process, not just a one-time event. Key practices include:

1. **Daily Knowledge Intake**: Dedicate time each day to learn something new, whether it's reading, listening, or watching educational content.
2. **Regularly Updating Notes**: Consistently update your notes with new information and insights.
3. **Application of Knowledge**: Apply what you've learned in real-life scenarios to reinforce understanding.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Create a feedback loop by revisiting and refining your knowledge based on new experiences.
