title: Goals
---
- Increase subscriber base to 10k
- Achieve 95% customer satisfaction
- Ship Smart Server v1
- Publish weekly tutorial videos


## HOW
#### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- Goals blur without tying metrics to supporter outcomes and Smart Plugin adoption.
- Job-to-be-done: "Translate strategic ambitions into measurable Smart Vault scorecards."
- Dramatic question: Can we prove Smart Plugins move headline metrics quarterly?
- Pain now: Goals mention "increase subscribers" without linking to funnel instrumentation.
- Stakes if unchanged: Hard to justify roadmap priorities to stakeholders.
- Prize if this works: Crystal clear scoreboard aligning vault work with revenue and retention.
- Relatable friction: Leadership asks for progress and only qualitative stories exist.
- Before snapshot: Goals scattered in decks and meeting notes.
- After snapshot: Every goal note tracks KPIs, lead measures, and supporting projects.
- GTD horizon link: Anchors Horizon 4 and informs Horizon 3 areas.
- Hook to common struggle: Many PKM systems stop at tasks without strategy linkage.
- One-sentence version: Strategic scoreboards with Smart Plugin fingerprints.

#### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- Decisive choice: Limit goals to 3â€“4 concurrent strategic outcomes.
- First principles: Each goal requires a lead measure, lag measure, and owner.
- Method boundary: Use YAML keys `lag_metric`, `lead_metric`, `owner`, `target_date`.
- Key definitions: Lead measures indicate Smart Plugin leverage; lag measures show business impact.
- Key term boundaries: Key Results differ from projectsâ€”they measure, not describe work.
- Concrete examples: Goal "Achieve 95% customer satisfaction" ties to lead measure "Smart Server response time <500ms".
- Tradeoffs: Fewer goals mean some initiatives wait, but focus increases impact.
- Anti-goals: Avoid vanity metrics lacking supporter relevance.
- Required inputs: Baseline values, target values, measurement cadence, data source.
- Constraints: Each goal must reference at least one Smart Plugin-enabled project.
- Beliefs that justify choice: Storytelling plus metrics builds supporter trust.
- Non-fit cases: Personal development aspirations (capture separately).
- GTD horizon link: Feeds into quarterly review across areas and projects.
- Success criteria: Goals show updated metrics and short narrative each review cycle.

#### Causal map and second and third order effects
- Cause chain: Set goal â†’ Define measures â†’ Align projects â†’ Execute â†’ Review metrics.
- Key levers: Weekly lead metric review and monthly lag metric evaluation.
- Second-order wins: Clarifies which Smart Plugin investments deliver ROI.
- Second-order risks: Overfitting to metrics may ignore qualitative signals.
- Third-order externalities: Supporter messaging sharpens with metric-backed stories.
- Debts or maintenance costs: Data pipelines must stay accurate to maintain trust.
- Contrasting failed paths: Goals set and forgotten without measurement loops.
- Ladder of abstraction: Daily actions ladder into quarterly impact statements.
- Early signals: Lead measures trending toward targets within first month.
- Measurable metrics: Variance to target, cadence adherence, number of supporting stories.
- Falsifiable assumptions: If metrics move but supporters churn, measurement set is incomplete.
- GTD bridge: Connects weekly reviews to quarterly adjustments.

#### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- Pattern name: Smart Vault goal scoreboard.
- Minimal loop: Define metric â†’ Log baseline â†’ Update cadence â†’ Share narrative.
- Checkable steps: Record baseline, link supporting projects, log review note, adjust plan.
- Needed templates: `smart-templates/default/goal.md` with metrics table and narrative block.
- Local-first instructions: Store metric history in markdown table for CLI aggregation.
- File-over-app notes: Reference CSV exports or graphs using relative links.
- Agency metrics: Percentage of goals with current metrics and active supporting projects.
- Stop conditions: Sunset goal when met, when strategy shifts, or when lead metrics stall for 2 quarters.
- Definition of done: Goal archived with lessons learned summary and metric chart.
- Reuse paths across tools: Sync goal data to investor or supporter updates as needed.
- Community reciprocity steps: Publish anonymized goal dashboards to highlight Smart Plugin ROI.
- Credits and sources: [[ðŸ§© Smart Plugins]], supporter analytics, marketing attribution data.
- GTD link: Feed status into monthly review and quarterly retrospective notes.

#### Visual and narrative execution plan
- McKee beats: Setup (ambitious target) â†’ Complication (metrics lag) â†’ Climax (plugin iteration breakthrough) â†’ Resolution (target hit).
- First-person lines: "Our lead metric jumped once Smart Connections automated supporter tagging."
- Pattern interrupt: Switch from spreadsheet to Smart Vault goal note mid-demo.
- Single visual metaphor: Scoreboard with lights indicating lead/lag status.
- Literal visualization: Table of metrics with sparkline-style ASCII trends.
- Whiteboard sketch moments: Plot cause-effect chain from plugin enhancements to revenue.
- High-impact visuals: Overlay Smart Server audit entries when describing lead metric improvements.
- Dramatization moments: Before/after clips of supporter onboarding metrics.
- B-roll, graphics, and captures: Screenshots of analytics dashboards, CLI exports, monthly review callouts.
- Eye contact and posture cues: Strong stance while sharing results, reflective tone during lessons learned.
- Wardrobe and background choices: Crisp presentation to signal strategic importance.
- On-screen text and lower thirds: Display metric deltas and owners.
- Post-production polish beats: Animated arrows showing trend improvements.
- Measured call to action: Invite supporters to review the metric template and adapt.
- Calendar blocks for execution: Weekly lead metric check Monday, monthly lag review first Tuesday.
- 70 percent eye contact look: Focus on camera when revealing metric progress, glance at charts for specifics.
- Open palms and relaxed shoulders signal: Communicate openness to questions about results.
- Straw hat and shirt cue evoke: Optional friendly vibe when celebrating milestone wins.
