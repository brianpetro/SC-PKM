title: Areas of Focus
---
- Personal Development
- Product Quality
- Customer Support
- Community Building


## HOW
#### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- Areas drift because responsibilities change faster than the vault structure.
- Job-to-be-done: "Keep Smart Vault reflecting active commitments across product, marketing, and community."
- Dramatic question: Does every area make it obvious how Smart Plugins sustain quality?
- Pain now: Hard to answer "Who owns supporter engagement" without scanning multiple folders.
- Stakes if unchanged: Reviews become reactive and automation coverage goes dark.
- Prize if this works: Clear guardrails for routing new plugin ideas into the right owner area.
- Relatable friction: Community requests end up in Smart Chat transcripts but lack an accountable area.
- Before snapshot: Responsibility lists live in personal notes outside the shared vault.
- After snapshot: Each area note has purpose, standards, and plugin metrics.
- GTD horizon link: Anchors Horizon 3 commitments and informs Horizon 2 projects.
- Hook to common struggle: Small teams juggle many hats without an accountability map.
- One-sentence version: Living operating agreements for Smart Vault stewards.

#### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- Decisive choice: Document ownership, standards, and key rhythms for each area.
- First principles: Stewardship requires explicit quality bars and automation coverage.
- Method boundary: Use frontmatter keys `owner`, `cadence`, `quality_bars`.
- Key definitions: Area = ongoing responsibility that never "completes" but evolves.
- Key term boundaries: Goals belong to Horizon 4; day-to-day tasks stay in Horizons 1â€“2.
- Concrete examples: Customer Support area lists Smart Server audit monitoring weekly.
- Tradeoffs: Too much detail adds maintenance overhead; too little fails to guide handoffs.
- Anti-goals: Avoid replicating full SOPsâ€”link to canonical docs instead.
- Required inputs: Owner, primary Smart Plugin dependencies, review cadence, key KPIs.
- Constraints: Each area note must include at least one automation health metric.
- Beliefs that justify choice: Explicit area stewardship unlocks delegation and scaling.
- Non-fit cases: Temporary task forces (documented as projects instead).
- GTD horizon link: Maintains clarity between Horizon 3 commitments and Horizon 4 aspirations.
- Success criteria: Review cadence executed, metrics updated, owner listed.

#### Causal map and second and third order effects
- Cause chain: Area defined â†’ Standards documented â†’ Metrics tracked â†’ Reviews scheduled.
- Key levers: Scheduled cadence and dataview dashboards showing status.
- Second-order wins: New contributors ramp faster thanks to clear quality bars.
- Second-order risks: Owners change without updating note, causing gaps.
- Third-order externalities: Supporter trust grows because responsibilities rarely slip.
- Debts or maintenance costs: Metrics require automation or manual updates to stay relevant.
- Contrasting failed paths: Areas implied in Slack threads but not written down.
- Ladder of abstraction: Individual tasks roll into area maintenance narratives.
- Early signals: Owners proactively update notes before reviews.
- Measurable metrics: SLA compliance, automation uptime, supporter response scores.
- Falsifiable assumptions: If automation metrics stay green but issues persist, definitions are wrong.
- GTD bridge: Guides weekly review to inspect each area with context.

#### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- Pattern name: Smart Vault area stewardship.
- Minimal loop: Define owner â†’ List standards â†’ Track metrics â†’ Schedule review.
- Checkable steps: Confirm owner, update metrics, link automation dashboards, log improvements.
- Needed templates: `smart-templates/default/area.md` with owner, cadence, and guardrails.
- Local-first instructions: Store metrics as markdown tables for easy CLI parsing.
- File-over-app notes: Reference exported dashboards with relative image links.
- Agency metrics: Percent of areas reviewed on schedule and metrics updated within 48 hours.
- Stop conditions: Reassign or sunset area when metrics show zero activity for a quarter.
- Definition of done: Area note updated, review logged, automation status captured.
- Reuse paths across tools: Sync owner and cadence fields to shared team calendar if required.
- Community reciprocity steps: Publish anonymized stewardship frameworks in supporter forums.
- Credits and sources: [[ðŸ§© Smart Plugins]], GTD Horizons, supporter success interviews.
- GTD link: Areas feed into weekly review notes and monthly retrospectives.

#### Visual and narrative execution plan
- McKee beats: Setup (ambiguous ownership) â†’ Complication (missed quality bar) â†’ Climax (review clarifies owner) â†’ Resolution (area stabilized).
- First-person lines: "This note tells me exactly how Smart Plugins keep Support smooth."
- Pattern interrupt: Flip from dataview summary to the raw area note to show transparency.
- Single visual metaphor: Control panels with gauges indicating automation health.
- Literal visualization: Table of KPIs and their Smart Plugin feed.
- Whiteboard sketch moments: Map responsibilities to plugin automations live.
- High-impact visuals: Overlay uptime charts from Smart Server logs.
- Dramatization moments: Show before/after of area note after a review retro.
- B-roll, graphics, and captures: Calendar invites, dataview dashboards, plugin log exports.
- Eye contact and posture cues: Confident stance when assigning ownership, softer tone during review insights.
- Wardrobe and background choices: Use consistent background to emphasize stability and stewardship.
- On-screen text and lower thirds: Display owner names and review cadences.
- Post-production polish beats: Highlight metric changes with animated arrows.
- Measured call to action: Encourage supporters to adapt the area stewardship template.
- Calendar blocks for execution: First Monday stewardship review, third Thursday automation audit.
- 70 percent eye contact look: Address camera when explaining responsibilities, glance at screen for dashboards.
- Open palms and relaxed shoulders signal: Communicate approachability for feedback.
- Straw hat and shirt cue evoke: Optional visual when discussing community-focused areas.
