- [ ] Schedule team sync for roadmap review


## HOW
#### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- Inboxes overflow and the next physical move is unclear when Smart Plugins surface new tasks.
- Job-to-be-done: "Turn Smart Connections insights into a doable action within minutes."
- Dramatic question: Can this vault help me decide what to do in the next focus block?
- Pain now: Clarifying context-rich plugin suggestions still requires manual filtering.
- Stakes if unchanged: Demo sessions stall because no single action feels trustworthy.
- Prize if this works: Confident, rapid execution that proves Smart Plugins accelerate momentum.
- Relatable friction: The supporter list export sits idle because no follow-up checklist exists.
- Before snapshot: Notes, chat transcripts, and plugin prompts live in separate folders.
- After snapshot: Each capture becomes a checkbox with owner, context, and link back to source.
- GTD horizon link: Aligns Horizon 1 with Horizon 2 projects maintained in this vault.
- Hook to common struggle: Obsidian users drown in ideas without a single "do this now" list.
- One-sentence version: A filtered runway of next steps generated from Smart Plugin insights.

#### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- Decisive choice: Process every capture into a verb-first checkbox or discard it.
- First principles: A next action must be independent, observable, and completable in one sitting.
- Method boundary: Only use tags `#context`, `#energy`, `#location` defined in Smart Vault taxonomy.
- Key definitions: `#context` groups related Smart Plugin surfaces (chat, MCP, supporter outreach).
- Key term boundaries: Someday/Maybe lives in `PKM/Ideas` so this list stays execution-ready.
- Concrete examples: Convert "prep supporter email" into "Write warm intro for monthly pledge".
- Tradeoffs: Aggressive pruning may hide creative options but keeps demos crisp.
- Anti-goals: Avoid storing multi-step plans hereâ€”promote them to `2_projects` instead.
- Required inputs: Capture note, plugin output snippet, owner, due signal.
- Constraints: Maintain <20 open actions to keep demos teachable.
- Beliefs that justify choice: Clarity beats volume when showcasing Smart Plugins.
- Non-fit cases: Collaborative projects needing Kanban boards belong in shared vaults.
- GTD horizon link: Maintains traceability to Horizon 2 outcomes referenced in metadata.
- Success criteria: Every checkbox links to a source note and updates during weekly review.

#### Causal map and second and third order effects
- Cause chain: Capture â†’ Clarify â†’ Tag contexts â†’ Schedule focus block â†’ Mark done.
- Key levers: Daily inbox zero and linking actions to Smart Plugin output blocks.
- Second-order wins: Supporters learn how Smart Plugins shorten time-to-action.
- Second-order risks: Over-tagging slows capture speed during live demos.
- Third-order externalities: Team members adopt the context taxonomy and align terminology.
- Debts or maintenance costs: Stale tags erode trust in Smart Plugin suggestions.
- Contrasting failed paths: Leaving plugin results in chat with no follow-up tasks.
- Ladder of abstraction: Action â†’ Project â†’ Area â†’ Vision anchored by metadata fields.
- Early signals: Completed count rises weekly and contexts rotate evenly.
- Measurable metrics: Average age of open actions, number of actions per plugin insight, completion velocity.
- Falsifiable assumptions: If actions exist but demos still stall, contexts are too coarse.
- GTD bridge: Provides the execution loop that demonstrates Smart Plugins value.

#### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- Pattern name: Smart Vault action runway.
- Minimal loop: Capture note with `[[Smart Plugins#Log]]` link â†’ convert to checkbox â†’ tag context.
- Checkable steps: Empty capture note, triage inbox, link supporting context, review daily.
- Needed templates: `smart-templates/default/action.md` snippet with owner and context fields.
- Local-first instructions: Keep metadata in YAML to sync with CLI without APIs.
- File-over-app notes: Use markdown tasks with footnotes pointing to plugin transcripts.
- Agency metrics: Percent of Smart Plugin suggestions converted into done checkboxes.
- Stop conditions: Pause when >5 actions lack source links or repeated contexts show friction.
- Definition of done: Action checked off with meeting notes or artifact stored alongside.
- Reuse paths across tools: Export tasks to CSV for supporter email campaigns when needed.
- Community reciprocity steps: Share refined contexts back to [[Smart Vault notes archetype]].
- Credits and sources: [[ðŸ§© Smart Plugins]], GTD fundamentals, supporter onboarding interviews.
- GTD link: Reference Horizon 1 list during weekly review triggered via `review.md` checklist.

#### Visual and narrative execution plan
- McKee beats: Setup (chaotic inbox) â†’ Complication (plugin overload) â†’ Climax (triage session) â†’ Resolution (clear runway).
- First-person lines: "I trust every checkbox in Smart Vault because it links to the originating plugin insight."
- Pattern interrupt: Toggle dataview query to show before/after contexts in demo recording.
- Single visual metaphor: Conveyor belt sorting plugin suggestions into neat action bins.
- Literal visualization: Screenshot of Obsidian task query filtered by `#context`.
- Whiteboard sketch moments: Map the capture loop with plugin icons feeding into GTD list.
- High-impact visuals: Animated highlight when linking action back to Smart Plugin output.
- Dramatization moments: Show time-lapse of clearing 10 plugin suggestions in under 5 minutes.
- B-roll, graphics, and captures: Cursor tours of Smart Plugins panel, CLI capture workflow, README snippet.
- Eye contact and posture cues: Lean in when stressing clarity; relax once the list empties.
- Wardrobe and background choices: Bright desk lighting underscores "clear runway" narrative.
- On-screen text and lower thirds: Display context tags and plugin names during walkthrough.
- Post-production polish beats: Layer subtle sound cue when checkbox completes.
- Measured call to action: Invite viewers to duplicate Smart Vault and run the capture drill.
- Calendar blocks for execution: Capture daily at 08:30, review at 16:30, weekly audit Friday 14:00.
- 70 percent eye contact look: Alternate between lens and screen when linking notes.
- Open palms and relaxed shoulders signal: Reinforce psychological safety of a trusted system.
- Straw hat and shirt cue evoke: Optional callback to "calm craftsman" vibe in supporter storytelling.
