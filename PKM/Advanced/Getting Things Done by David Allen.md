## Overview of GTD
GTD is a time management method developed by David Allen. It focuses on capturing tasks and organizing them for effective execution.

### Capturing Tasks
In GTD, all tasks, ideas, and projects are captured in an external system, freeing mental space for execution.

### Organizing Tasks
Tasks are categorized by their next actions and context, such as calls to make or emails to send.

### Reviewing Tasks
Frequent reviews ensure tasks are up to date and that nothing falls through the cracks. Weekly reviews are a key part of the system.

### Executing Tasks
With a clear next action for each task, GTD allows for more efficient execution and reduced procrastination.


This classic GTD framework is reinterpreted inside the Smart Vault to show how Smart Chat and Smart Drafts enable natural capture, clarification, and action.

## Behavior
Users build their GTD system in Obsidian by letting Smart Connections surface relevant projects or actions, while GPT helps clarify ambiguous entries.

## Takeaway
Smart Ecosystem tools turn GTD from theory into daily flowâ€”bridging gaps between thought and execution without friction.
