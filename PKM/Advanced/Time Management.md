# Time Management

Integrating PKM with time management systems, such as GTD (Getting Things Done), helps in optimizing productivity and ensuring that knowledge is applied efficiently. Key strategies include:

1. **GTD Methodology**: Implementing GTD principles to manage tasks and projects while keeping your PKM system up-to-date.
2. **Time Blocking**: Allocating specific time slots for knowledge capture, review, and synthesis.
3. **Prioritization**: Using PKM to identify and focus on high-priority tasks and information.
4. **Task Integration**: Linking tasks and projects in your PKM system for better alignment and execution.
