# Networked Thought

Networked thought refers to the practice of linking related ideas and notes within your PKM system. This approach fosters deeper insights and connections between concepts. Key practices include:

1. **Bi-directional Links**: Use bi-directional links to create connections between notes, allowing ideas to reference each other.
2. **Graph View**: Leverage tools that offer a graph view (e.g., Obsidian) to visualize connections between notes.
3. **Contextual Connections**: Regularly link new notes to existing ones to build a web of knowledge.
4. **Cross-referencing**: Use cross-referencing to explore relationships between different concepts.

**Keywords**: Networked Thought, Bi-directional Links, Graph View, Cross-referencing

For techniques on visualizing connections between ideas, see [[PKM/Advanced/Mind Mapping]].

Instead of isolated folders, let ideas connect in meaningful webs.

### Why It Works
- Mimics how the brain works
- Encourages emergence of new insights

### How to Apply It
- Use bidirectional links
- Keep notes atomic (see: [[Atomic Notes Strategy]])
- Use [[PKM/Advanced/Mind Mapping]] and [[Smart Connections Overview]] to visualize ideas

### Smart Angle
Your vault becomes a dynamic idea space. AI can help uncover connections you might miss.
