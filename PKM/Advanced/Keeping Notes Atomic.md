- Keep each note focused on a single concept or idea.
- Avoid merging multiple topics into one note to maintain clarity and ease of linking.
- *What specific types of concepts or ideas should be prioritized in a note?*
	- Prioritize fundamental concepts, definitions, principles, and standalone facts that can act as building blocks for broader understanding.
- Atomic notes are the building blocks of clarity in your PKM system.

### Principle
- Focus each note on a single, self-contained idea.
- Make sure it stands aloneâ€”someone should grasp its meaning without needing other notes.
- How can you determine if a note is truly self-contained?
	- Review if the note provides sufficient context and explanation to be understood independently.
- What strategies help ensure notes stand alone effectively?
	- Use clear definitions, include examples where necessary, and avoid references to content only explained elsewhere.
### Benefits
- Easier to link, remix, and evolve over time.
- *What processes support the linking and remixing of atomic notes most effectively?*
	- Utilizing consistent tagging, clear titles, and explicit linking strategies like backlinks and mapping notes enhances effective linking and remixing.
Atomic notes act like flexible puzzle pieces. Because they express one thought clearly, you can combine them in endless ways to develop bigger ideas without confusion or overlap.

- *What are the key principles of the Zettelkasten Method that align with atomic notes?*
	- Individuality of notes, clear links between notes, and a focus on ideas rather than just information.
- *Which note-taking techniques best support creating atomic notes?*
	- Techniques like the Cornell Method, progressive summarization, and mind mapping help isolate and develop single ideas effectively.
- *How can consistency be measured or improved in maintaining atomic note structure?*
	- Regular review audits, using templates or checklists, and maintaining a style guide for notes help improve and measure consistency.
