Building a second brain isn’t just about storage—it’s about thinking with your tools. 
## What is a Second Brain
The Second Brain is a system for externalizing thoughts and ideas to aid memory and creativity. It focuses on building a digital knowledge repository.
## Building a Second Brain
- Capture everything from thoughts to resources.
- Organize information for quick access.
- Connect notes and ideas to see patterns.
## Organizing Information
- Use tags, folders, and links to structure knowledge.
- Prioritize linking notes to related ideas.

## Tiago Forte's Methodology
Tiago Forte popularized the Second Brain concept through his course, focusing on personal productivity and knowledge management.

This note is the philosophical link between Smart Vault workflows and the second brain idea. It illustrates how a well-structured vault, supported by Smart Connections and GPT, becomes a trusted thinking partner.

## Behavior
Smart Drafts help capture and evolve notes in context. Smart Chat lets your notes talk back—filling gaps, reframing, and prompting reflection.

## Takeaway
The Smart Ecosystem turns your vault into a responsive, evolving second brain. One that helps you think, not just remember.


Your Second Brain is an external system that captures, organizes, and retrieves your thoughts — freeing up your mind to think and create.

Popularized by Tiago Forte, it’s the modern evolution of PKM.
