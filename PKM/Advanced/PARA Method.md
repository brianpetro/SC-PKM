## Overview of PARA
PARA is a system for organizing information and tasks, developed by Tiago Forte. It stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

## Projects in PARA
Projects are short-term efforts with a specific goal. Each project should have clear action items and a deadline.

## Areas in PARA
Areas are long-term responsibilities, such as health or finance. These are ongoing and require consistent attention.

## Resources in PARA
Resources include reference material, knowledge, and tools. These are organized by topic.

## Archives in PARA
Archives contain information from completed projects or resources that are no longer actively used.

PARA is one of the most powerful frameworks for organizing a vault‚Äîand in Smart Vault, it's supercharged with automation and relevance.

## Behavior
Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives are stored as distinct folders. Smart Connections automatically links relevant notes across PARA layers. Smart Chat helps clarify if a note fits in P, A, R, or A‚Äîon the fly.

## Takeaway
The Smart Ecosystem makes PARA intuitive, not rigid. You don‚Äôt manage folders‚Äîyou navigate purposefully linked ideas.


The PARA Method, created by Tiago Forte, organizes your digital life into four simple buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

### üîß The Structure
1. **Projects** ‚Äî Short-term efforts with a goal
2. **Areas** ‚Äî Long-term responsibilities (e.g. health, finance)
3. **Resources** ‚Äî Topics of interest or reference
4. **Archives** ‚Äî Inactive but saved material

### üß† Why Use PARA?
- Reduces clutter and decision fatigue
