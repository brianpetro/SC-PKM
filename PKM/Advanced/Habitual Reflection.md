# Habitual Reflection

Habitual reflection is a powerful tool in PKM for ensuring that your knowledge stays relevant and meaningful. Reflection allows you to assess what you’ve learned, identify gaps, and reinforce key concepts. Key practices include:

1. **Daily Journaling**: Keep a daily journal to reflect on what you’ve learned and how it applies to your goals.
2. **Weekly Review**: Schedule a weekly review session to revisit your notes and identify key insights.
3. **Monthly Synthesis**: At the end of each month, synthesize your learning and update your PKM system accordingly.
4. **Personal Growth Tracking**: Track your progress over time and adjust your learning strategies as needed.
