- Linking notes creates relationships that allow for cross-disciplinary connections and deeper understanding.
- Tags help unify ideas across different subjects and contexts.


Concepts don’t live in isolation — they gain meaning from how they connect. Mapping those links builds a deeper, more flexible PKM system.

### 🧠 Why Concept Relationships Matter
- Helps form new ideas by combining existing ones
- Encourages cross-domain thinking
- Builds a mental model that’s easier to navigate

### 🛠️ How to Show Relationships
- Use explicit links: “This supports → That”
- Cluster related notes visually or with tags
- Write synthesis notes that connect ideas

### ✅ Try This
