## Effective Tagging Strategies
Use tags to categorize notes by topic, project, or theme. Consistent tagging enhances organization and searchability.

## Creating Meaningful Links
Links should be contextually relevant and help form a web of knowledge across different notes.

## Bidirectional Linking

Tags and links are the connective tissue of your knowledge base. They transform isolated notes into a thinking network.

### üß† Purpose
- **Tags** group by theme or purpose
- **Links** show direct relationships or references

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Them
**Tags**
- Use for high-level categories: `#project`, `#idea`, `#archive`
- Don‚Äôt overtag ‚Äî aim for signal, not search clutter

**Links**
- Always link to related atomic notes
- Link new content during daily or weekly review

### üß© Related Notes
- [[Linking Your Thinking]]
- [[Consistency in Note Taking]]
- [[Networked Thought]]
- [[Relationships Between Concepts]]

### ‚úÖ Try This
Open any recent note and:
- Add 1 relevant tag (e.g. `#tool`, `#note-type`, `#topic`)
- Link to 2 other notes ‚Äî something upstream (origin) and downstream (application)

Ensure that links between notes go both ways, allowing for easy navigation back and forth between related ideas.

Connecting ideas is the heart of powerful knowledge systems.

### Tagging
- Use tags for flexible grouping
- Be consistent, not excessive
- Good tags: #project, #idea, #reference

### Linking
- Link to concepts, not just titles
- Encourage emergence of new patterns (see: [[Networked Thought]])

- [[Smart Connections Overview]] can recommend links
- [[Auto-Tagging with AI]] can suggest new categories automatically
