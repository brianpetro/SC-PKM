Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is a process and set of practices for collecting, organizing, and using knowledge efficiently to improve learning, decision-making, and personal productivity.

PKM is your personal approach to capturing, refining, and using knowledge.
PKM is how individuals take control of their learning, thinking, and knowledge creation.
It’s about capturing what matters, connecting it meaningfully, and using it to create.

### PKM as a Lifestyle
- Integrates with your day-to-day work and learning
- Evolves with your tools, thinking, and goals

### Misconceptions
- You don’t need to save *everything*
- Fancy tools help, but mindset and practice matter more
- You don't need a perfect system from day one

### Start Simple
- Use atomic notes (see: [[Atomic Notes Strategy]])
- Reflect regularly (see: [[Daily Review Habit]])
### In Practice
- Think in atomic notes
- Reflect regularly (see: [[Reviewing and Reflecting]])
