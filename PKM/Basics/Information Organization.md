## Hierarchical Organization
Organizes notes into layers using folders or headings, creating a tree-like structure.

## Networked Organization
Links notes together non-linearly, forming a web of ideas and connections.

## Tagging Systems
Tags categorize notes by topic or theme, making it easier to find related information across different areas.

## Folders vs. Tags
While folders create a rigid structure, tags allow for more flexibility in organizing and retrieving information.

How you structure knowledge determines how useful it becomes later.

### Strategies
- Tags vs. Folders: Combine for maximum retrieval
- PARA: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives â†’ see [[PARA Method]]
- Atomic Notes: Small, linkable units

### Tools to Support
- Obsidian for structure
- [[Tagging and Linking]] for consistency
