- Develop a routine for capturing and processing notes daily or weekly.

Consistency is what transforms scattered notes into a trusted system. Without it, your vault becomes a collection — with it, it becomes a tool.

### 🧠 Why It Matters
- Reduces friction when writing or capturing
- Builds memory through repetition
- Makes review and linking easier

### 📐 What to Standardize
- **Note format** — Use shared templates or headers
