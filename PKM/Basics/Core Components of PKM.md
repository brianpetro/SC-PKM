t # Core Components of PKM

The key components of PKM include:

1. **Capture**: Collecting knowledge from various sources such as books, articles, conversations, and personal experiences.
2. **Curate**: Organizing and categorizing the captured knowledge into meaningful structures.
3. **Store**: Safely storing the curated knowledge in a retrievable format.
4. **Retrieve**: Efficiently finding and recalling the stored knowledge when needed.
5. **Share**: Disseminating the knowledge with others to expand its impact.

A good PKM system isn’t about perfection—it’s about flow. These five components keep knowledge moving, evolving, and paying off in your daily work.

#### 1. **Capture**
Grab ideas when they show up—no judgment, no polish. Notes, voice memos, clippings, sketches. The point is to *catch the spark*.

#### 2. **Curate**
Later, sort the noise from the signals. Label, link, or trim. Curation is where insight begins.

#### 3. **Store**
Put things where they can be found again. Whether that’s folders, tags, or AI-backed semantic search, it should feel effortless.

#### 4. **Retrieve**
You need to *trust* that when you search, you’ll find. Retrieval means fast access to what you need—just in time.

#### 5. **Share**
PKM isn’t just personal. Sharing what you’ve synthesized helps others—and sharpens your own thinking.

These parts aren’t steps—they’re a cycle. The stronger your loop, the more useful your PKM system becomes.

A good PKM system flows through five key stages: Capture, Curate, Store, Retrieve, and Share.

### Capture
Get ideas out of your head quickly. Use tools like [[Capture Tools]] or a centralized inbox.

### Curate
Refine raw info into meaning. Link related notes, summarize, and clean up input.

### Store
Use a [[Centralized Repository]] for structure. Organize with tags, folders, or methods like [[PARA Method]].

### Retrieve
Make your notes findable with links, smart filters, or semantic search. See: [[Efficient Retrieval]]

### Share
Turn your insights into blogs, talks, or guidance. Related: [[Creating Output]], [[Sharing Knowledge]]
