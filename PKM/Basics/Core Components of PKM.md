1. Capture: Collecting knowledge from various sources such as books, articles, conversations, and personal experiences.
2. Curate: Organizing and categorizing the captured knowledge into meaningful structures.
3. Store: Safely storing the curated knowledge in a retrievable format.
4. Retrieve: Efficiently finding and recalling the stored knowledge when needed.
5. Share: Disseminating the knowledge with others to expand its impact.

A good PKM system isn’t about perfection—it’s about flow. These five components keep knowledge moving, evolving, and paying off in your daily work.

These parts aren’t steps—they’re a cycle. The stronger your loop, the more useful your PKM system becomes.

A good PKM system flows through five key stages: Capture, Curate, Store, Retrieve, and Share.
