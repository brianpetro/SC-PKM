# Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Vault

Welcome to the **PKM Vault**, a comprehensive and structured resource dedicated to mastering **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**. This repository is designed to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful note-taking and knowledge management tool that excels in linking and connecting notes using markdown files.

## ðŸ“‚ Overview

The **PKM Vault** is organized using the *Atomic Notes* strategy, meaning each note focuses on one concept or idea. This structure is designed for clarity, ease of linking, and reusability. Inside, you'll find information on PKM strategies, tools, techniques, and case studies to help you build or enhance your own PKM system.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred location.

### 2. Open in Obsidian
Once you have the repository on your local machine:
1. Open **Obsidian**.
2. Click on `Open folder as vault` and navigate to the location where you cloned or extracted the repository.
3. Select the `PKM Vault` folder. Obsidian will recognize the markdown files, enabling full linking and organization features.

### 3. Explore the Vault
The vault is divided into various folders covering topics like:
- **PKM Strategies** (Atomic Notes, Zettelkasten, PARA, and more)
- **PKM Tools** (Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, etc.)
- **PKM Techniques** (Note-taking methods, tagging, linking, etc.)
- **PKM Best Practices** (Consistency, reviews, knowledge synthesis)
- **PKM Examples** (Personal workflows, use cases)
- **PKM Books and Resources** (Summaries of influential PKM literature)
- **Connections** (Synthesizing how different strategies and tools connect)


## ðŸ§  Smart Connections Integration

This vault also serves as a practical example of how to use the [**Smart Connections Plugin**](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/) in Obsidian. The plugin enhances PKM by surfacing connections between notes, concepts, and ideas through semantic search and knowledge graphs. By leveraging this tool, you can easily explore relationships and patterns between PKM topics in this vault.
