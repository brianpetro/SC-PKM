- **Definition:** A mental state where a person is fully immersed in an activity, with a feeling of energized focus and enjoyment.
- **Characteristic:** Often occurs when the challenge of a task is balanced with one's skill level, leading to a loss of sense of time.
- **Benefit:** Working in flow can lead to high productivity and creativity, as well as personal satisfaction in the task.

It’s usually triggered by a mix of challenge and skill—just hard enough to stay engaged, but not overwhelming.

Ask yourself:
- What kind of tasks help me lose track of time?
- What conditions make flow more likely for me?
- How can I build more of that into my schedule?

Flow state is a deeply focused mental state where you lose track of time and become fully immersed in a task.
