# Centralized Repository

A centralized repository is crucial for a well-organized PKM system. It ensures that all knowledge is stored in a single, easily accessible location. Key practices include:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one primary location for all knowledge storage.
2. **Cloud Storage**: Use cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for access anywhere.
3. **Version Control**: Implement version control to keep track of changes and updates.
4. **Backup**: Regularly back up your repository to prevent data loss.
