### Philosophy & Stoicism in Life

- Stoicism is an ancient philosophy teaching the development of self-control and fortitude to overcome destructive emotions; it emphasizes focusing on what one can control and accepting what one cannot.
- In a modern context, applying Stoicism or other philosophies can provide a framework for dealing with life's difficulties and finding meaning through virtue and wisdom.
- Embracing philosophical principles can guide personal growth and resilience by encouraging reflection on one’s actions and alignment with a well-lived life.

**Key:**
- Meaning in Suffering (Logotherapy)
- Overcoming an Existential Crisis
- Self-Transcendence

- [[Simplicity & Essentialism]] and [[Self-Transcendence]] could round it out with values-based minimalism and purpose beyond self.

These connections offer both depth and real-world application.


Here are a few core Stoic ideas worth reflecting on:
- You can’t control external events, only your responses.
- Regularly reflect on mortality (memento mori).
- Virtue is the highest good.

Try journaling or thinking through a recent challenge using these lenses. What shifted?

If this sparks deeper thought, consider exploring [[Personal Philosophy of Life]], [[Self-Actualization (Maslow)]], or [[Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)]]. Philosophy isn’t just an abstract concept—it’s a guide to how you live day by day.
