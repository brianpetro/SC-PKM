### Core Values Identification

- Core values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that drive an individual's decisions and behaviors.
- Identifying these values requires introspection and honesty about what truly matters to you (such as integrity, freedom, family, or creativity).
- Knowing your core values allows you to align your life choices with them, leading to greater consistency and integrity in how you live.

**Key:**
- Authenticity & Integrity
- Personal Philosophy of Life
- Value Alignment in Life


- **Definition:** The process of discovering the beliefs and principles that guide your decisions and give life meaning.

You might start by reflecting on moments that felt deeply rightâ€”or wrong. What was being honored or violated in those moments?

Some common values include:
- Growth
- Freedom
- Connection
- Creativity
- Honesty

But your values are yours. Try narrowing it down to your top five. Then ask:
- Am I living these values daily?
- Where am I out of alignment?
- What shift would help me realign?
