### Self-Transcendence

- Self-transcendence goes beyond self-actualization, referring to the ability to look past one’s own needs and connect to something greater, such as helping others or a cause bigger than oneself.
- It often involves experiences of unity or oneness with others or the world, leading to profound feelings of purpose and peace.
- People may achieve self-transcendence through spirituality, altruism, or creative pursuits that make them feel part of a larger whole.

**Key:**
- Self-Actualization (Maslow)
- Spirituality & Meaning
- Service & Volunteering

- [[Contribution and Impact]] and [[Purpose & Passion]] are also helpful to illustrate real-life expressions of transcendence.

These connections help place the concept in both psychological and practical terms.


It often shows up through service, creativity, or awe. It’s where meaning deepens and ego loosens.

Ask yourself:
- When have I felt part of something bigger?
- What helps me move beyond self-concern?
- How does purpose show up in my day-to-day?

You might find this idea links with notes like [[Spirituality & Meaning]], [[Altruism & Kindness]], or [[Contribution and Impact]]. Self-transcendence doesn’t require a grand moment—it can start with a small, generous act.
