### Authenticity & Integrity

- Authenticity involves being true to oneself, expressing genuine thoughts and feelings rather than just conforming to external expectations.
- Integrity is the quality of upholding strong moral principles and being consistent in actions and values.
- Together, they encourage a life where you present your real self and make choices that reflect your convictions, fostering trust and self-respect.

But both can be hard. We all shape-shift sometimes to fit in, avoid conflict, or gain approval. That’s human. The point isn’t to be flawless—it’s to notice where the gaps are and gently close them.

You might explore:
- Where in my life am I hiding or holding back?
- What values do I want to express more clearly?
- How do I act when no one’s watching—and does that reflect who I want to be?

Living with authenticity and integrity isn’t about being rigid. It’s about showing up honestly and building a life that feels congruent from the inside out.
