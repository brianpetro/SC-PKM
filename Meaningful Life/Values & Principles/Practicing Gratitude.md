Practicing gratitude doesn’t mean ignoring problems. It means recognizing what’s already here that supports, nourishes, or inspires you.

Try these prompts:
- What’s something I’m grateful for today that I often overlook?
- Who in my life deserves more appreciation?
- What challenge taught me something valuable?

Gratitude builds resilience, emotional balance, and connection. It works especially well when practiced regularly—even if just in small doses.
