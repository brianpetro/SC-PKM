- Practicing gratitude involves intentionally noticing and appreciating the positive aspects of life, both big and small.
- This can be done through habits like keeping a gratitude journal or regularly reflecting on things you're thankful for.
- Over time, cultivating gratitude can increase overall happiness and help maintain a positive perspective, even during challenges.

These connections can turn gratitude from an idea into an integrated habit.

Practicing gratitude doesn’t mean ignoring problems. It means recognizing what’s already here that supports, nourishes, or inspires you.

You might reflect daily on:
- What surprised me with joy today?
- Who supported me, even in a small way?
- What have I taken for granted that deserves thanks?
- What’s something I’m grateful for today that I often overlook?
- Who in my life deserves more appreciation?
- What challenge taught me something valuable?

Gratitude builds resilience, emotional balance, and connection. It works especially well when practiced regularly—even if just in small doses.

This note pairs naturally with [[Meaningful Experiences]], [[Contentment in Life]], and [[Spirituality & Meaning]]—reminding us that fulfillment starts with presence.

I use note cards.
