Altruism goes a step further: giving without expecting return. It's a mindset that shifts your attention outward in a world that often pulls us inward.

But kindness and altruism aren’t always easy. You might reflect on:
- When is it hardest for me to be kind?
- What motivates my acts of giving?
- How do I balance compassion for others with self-respect?

Practicing kindness can be an antidote to burnout, resentment, and even loneliness. You could explore this alongside [[Self-Transcendence]], [[Contribution and Impact]], or [[Meaningful Relationships]] to see how these values show up in your life.

This isn’t about perfection—it’s about practicing a way of being that keeps you connected to what matters.
