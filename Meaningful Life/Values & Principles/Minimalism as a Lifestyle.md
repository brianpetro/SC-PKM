- By decluttering physical spaces and schedules, minimalists aim to reduce distractions and stress associated with materialism or busyness.

Ask yourself:
- What am I holding onto out of habit, fear, or inertia?
- What physical, mental, or digital clutter could I let go of?
- What do I want more space for in my life?

This isn’t about rules—it’s about conscious editing. Fewer distractions, deeper presence.
