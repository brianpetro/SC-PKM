According to Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s the peak of human needs. But it’s not a destination. It’s a way of being.

You can ask:
- When do I feel most alive or fully myself?
- What do I create or give when I’m at my best?
- What gets in the way of expressing my deeper self?

This note can spark reflections that show up across other areas like [[Personal Growth Plan]], [[Value Alignment in Life]], or [[Purpose & Passion]]. Keep coming back to it as your path evolves.


You might reflect on:
- When do I feel most like myself?
- What activities make me feel deeply fulfilled?
- Where in my life am I holding back my full expression?

It’s not about chasing perfection. It’s about tuning in to your deeper self and shaping your life around what energizes and aligns you.

This note pairs well with [[Personal Growth Plan]], [[Value Alignment in Life]], or [[Personal Philosophy of Life]] as part of an evolving exploration of who you’re becoming.
