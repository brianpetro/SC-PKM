It’s not complacency—it’s clarity. You can still have goals and desires, but they’re not rooted in lack.

Ask yourself:
- What do I already have that supports me?
- What expectations might I gently release?
- Where am I chasing more instead of appreciating now?

Contentment grows when we stop measuring and start noticing.
