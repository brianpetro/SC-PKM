**Lifelong Learning**

- **Definition:** The continuous pursuit of knowledge and skills throughout life, driven by curiosity and personal growth.
- **Benefit:** Keeps your mind sharp, opens new opportunities, and deepens your understanding of the world and yourself.
- **Tip:** Treat every day as a chance to learn—through books, podcasts, conversations, or challenges.

**Key:** Personal Growth Plan; Creativity & Self-Expression; Growth Mindset

You might reflect on:
- What excites me to learn right now?
- How do I like to learn—reading, doing, reflecting?
- Where have I been avoiding learning because of discomfort?

Even small, consistent learning keeps the mind flexible and life engaging.

This connects well with [[Creativity & Self-Expression]] or [[Personal Growth Plan]]—because growing minds often lead to growing lives.
