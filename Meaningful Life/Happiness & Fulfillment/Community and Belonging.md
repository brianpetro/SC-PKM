### Community and Belonging

- Feeling a sense of community and belonging involves being part of a group where you share common interests, values, or goals.
- Humans are social creatures, and having a community – whether local, spiritual, or based on a hobby – provides support and enhances one’s identity.
- Belonging to a community gives a feeling of being connected to something larger than oneself, which can be profoundly comforting and meaningful.

**Key:**
- Meaningful Relationships

Whether it’s family, friends, shared values, or place—belonging provides a kind of grounding. It reminds you that you’re not alone.

Ask yourself:
- Where do I feel most accepted and understood?
- What kind of communities do I want to build or strengthen?
- Where might I be holding back my full presence?

Belonging isn’t about fitting in—it’s about feeling safe enough to be fully seen.
