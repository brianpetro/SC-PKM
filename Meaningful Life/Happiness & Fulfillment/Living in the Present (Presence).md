This is easier said than done. But the more you practice it, the more you realize that presence isn’t just calming—it’s powerful. It allows you to respond instead of react, to notice instead of numb.

Ask yourself:
- What helps me return to this moment?
- What distractions pull me out of presence?
- Where do I feel most alive right now?

Practices like breath awareness, mindful walking, or simply putting your phone down can reconnect you.

Presence isn't about doing nothing. It's about showing up fully to whatever you’re doing.

Being present creates a deeper experience of ordinary life.
