**Life Story & Personal Narrative**

- **Definition:** The story we tell ourselves about who we are, where we’ve come from, and where we’re going.
- **Insight:** Our interpretation of events shapes our identity and emotional patterns.
- **Tip:** Revisit past experiences and consider how you might reframe them with a growth mindset.

**Key:** [[Identity and Life Roles]], [[Journaling for Self-Reflection]], [[Overcoming an Existential Crisis]]

- [[Personal Philosophy of Life]] could also enrich the narrative with a values-based perspective.

These links help ground storytelling in personal growth.


Use this note to write the story of your life so far. Not just the facts, but how they’ve made you who you are.

You might start with:
- Childhood memories that shaped you
- Turning points and transitions
- Moments of resilience or clarity

Don’t worry about linear order. Write what comes naturally.

Then ask: What’s the story I’ve been telling? What story do I want to live?

This note connects well with [[Identity and Life Roles]], [[Meaningful Experiences]], and [[Personal Growth Plan]]. It’s not just reflection—it’s authorship.
