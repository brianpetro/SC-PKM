### Personal Mission Statement

- A personal mission statement is a concise expression of an individual's core values and goals, serving as a guiding beacon for life decisions.
- Crafting it requires introspection to articulate what truly matters to you and what you hope to achieve or contribute.
- Having a personal mission can clarify priorities and keep you focused on living in accordance with your defined purpose.

**Key:**
- Discovering Life Purpose
- Passion Versus Purpose
- Identifying Core Values

It can steer your decisions, align your time effectively, and offer direction during uncertain moments.

Start with these reflective prompts:
- What kind of person do I aspire to be?
- What impact do I wish to create?
- What values do I want to embody?

Once you’ve created a draft, revisit and refine it regularly. Allow it to evolve as you grow.

This note connects well with [[Discovering Life Purpose]], [[Identifying Core Values]], and [[Contribution and Impact]]. Remember, it's not about achieving perfection—it’s about staying aligned with your true self.

- Your personal mission is like an inner compass—it helps guide decisions, filter opportunities, and align your energy with what matters most.
- A strong mission statement blends your values, vision, strengths, and desired impact into a living statement of intent.
- It’s not static. You’re allowed to revise it as you grow.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What legacy do I want to leave?
- What are the values I want to live out loud?
- How do I want others to feel after interacting with me?

**Example Formula:**
> *"I exist to [core contribution], by [how you deliver it], for [who/what you serve], guided by [key values]."*

> A mission statement is most powerful when lived, not just written. Let it evolve, let it guide, and let it speak your truth.
