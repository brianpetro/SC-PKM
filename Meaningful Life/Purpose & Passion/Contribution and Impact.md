### Contribution and Impact

- Contributing to something larger than oneself and seeing the impact of those efforts is a key aspect of finding meaning in life.
- This can take many forms, from volunteering and helping individuals, to innovating in one's profession, to creating art that moves people.
- Recognizing the effects of your actions on others or on the world can reinforce why your efforts matter.

**Improvement:**
- Contribution isn’t limited to big gestures—it includes everyday actions, quiet support, or behind-the-scenes care that sustains others.
- Impact grows when aligned with your strengths, values, and the communities or causes you care about most.
- Try asking: How do I want to be remembered by the people I interact with regularly?

**Practical Ways to Deepen Impact:**
- Choose one role or space in your life where you want to increase your impact (e.g., family, team, neighborhood).
- Create a “ripple list”—small, intentional actions you could take this week that might positively affect others.
- Ask trusted people how your presence or actions have mattered to them in the past—then amplify that.

Contribution isn’t a destination; it’s a habit of attention. By noticing where your energy naturally flows and investing that energy where it matters, you gradually build a life of meaningful impact.
