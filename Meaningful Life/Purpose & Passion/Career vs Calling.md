### Career vs Calling

- A career can be seen as a series of jobs or roles for financial gain and professional growth, whereas a calling is work that deeply aligns with one's values and purpose.
- Finding a calling means feeling that your work is meaningful and connected to a broader impact on society or a community.
- Balancing practical career needs with the search for a calling can lead to greater fulfillment in one's professional life.

**Improvement:**
- A career may offer stability and progress, but a calling often provides a sense of devotion or service. It’s not just about what you do—it’s about why you do it.
- For some, the ideal path blends both: using a career as a foundation while gradually shaping it to reflect one’s deeper calling.
- It’s also worth noting that callings aren’t always tied to jobs—they can be found in family roles, volunteer work, or creative projects.

**Key:**
- Passion vs Purpose
- Meaningful Work & Career
- Contribution and Impact


You might reflect on:
- Does my current work feel like a job, a career, or a calling?
- What kind of work energizes me, even when it’s hard?
- Would I still do this if money weren’t an issue?

Not every calling needs to be monetized. And not every job has to be soulless. The key is noticing where you feel resonance.

- A **career** typically emphasizes progression, achievement, and financial reward. It's a structure for professional growth. A **calling**, in contrast, is about deep alignment with your values, passions, and the desire to contribute to something beyond yourself.
- You can experience aspects of both. A job that pays the bills can still be infused with elements of purpose if you shape it to reflect what you care about.
- The modern approach is integration: cultivating a career path that evolves in the direction of your calling.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What work gives you energy and meaning, even during challenges?
- Where in your current role can you inject more of your values or passion?
- What would it look like to blend stability with significance?

> You don’t always have to choose between practicality and purpose. The path of fulfillment is often found in the overlap.
