### Ikigai (Life Purpose Framework)

- The Japanese concept of Ikigai refers to finding the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what can financially support you.
- Identifying your Ikigai can lead to a life filled with purpose, motivation, and satisfaction in both personal and professional spheres.
- It's a framework that encourages balance and fulfillment by aligning career and passion with a greater good.

**Key:**
- Life Purpose Discovery
- Passion vs Purpose
- Life Audit

To get the most from the Ikigai framework, take time with each of the four core questions:
- **What do I love?** Think about moments when you lose track of time or feel energized.
- **What am I good at?** Reflect on your strengths, skills others recognize in you, or things that come naturally.
- **What does the world need?** Look outward—what problems or needs do you feel called to contribute to?
- **What can I be paid for?** Consider skills or roles that are valuable and sustainable in today’s world.

Instead of rushing to find a single perfect answer, use these as prompts to explore multiple possibilities. Ikigai is not static—it evolves with your life experiences.

Try journaling responses over several days and look for emerging patterns or themes. Then test small steps toward areas of overlap.
