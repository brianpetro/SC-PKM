### Life Purpose Discovery

- Discovering one's overarching purpose can guide major life decisions and bring a sense of direction.
- It often requires self-reflection and exploration of personal values, passions, and strengths.
- A clear life purpose helps align daily actions with long-term fulfillment and meaning.

**Key:**
- Ikigai (Life Purpose Framework)
- Leaving a Legacy
- Personal Mission Statement


Start with these questions:
- What kind of problems do I feel drawn to solve?
- When do I feel most useful or alive?
- What experiences have made me feel part of something bigger?

Your purpose can evolve. You don’t need to get it “right.” You just need to get closer.

You might explore this alongside [[Ikigai (Life Purpose Framework)]], [[Meaningful Work & Career]], or [[Personal Mission Statement]]. Let this note grow with you.


- Discovering purpose is less about a singular breakthrough and more about a living inquiry—an ongoing exploration into what matters most.
- Purpose often emerges from patterns: what draws your energy, what challenges you embrace, what stories inspire you, and who you feel compelled to serve.
- Life purpose doesn’t have to be grand. Sometimes it’s quiet and steady. Sometimes it changes. What matters is that it feels real.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What have been the most meaningful moments or projects in your life?
- Where do you feel a sense of contribution, connection, or alignment?
- If you stopped striving, what truth would still call you forward?

> Let your life purpose unfold. It’s less about finding and more about recognizing what’s already there.
