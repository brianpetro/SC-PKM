### Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)

- *Memento mori* is a Latin phrase meaning "remember that you must die," a practice of reflecting on mortality to appreciate life more fully.
- By acknowledging the finite nature of life, individuals can gain perspective, letting petty concerns fall away and focusing on what truly matters.
- This reflection can inspire people to live more intentionally, cherish their loved ones, and pursue what is meaningful without procrastination.

**Key:**
- Meaning in Suffering (Logotherapy)
- Bucket List Creation
- Leaving a Legacy

- [[Life Story & Personal Narrative]] and [[Meditation & Mindfulness]] also offer ways to live with more awareness.

These connections help the idea of "memento mori" feel reflective rather than morbid.


Sometimes all it takes is a pause to ask:
- If this day were my last, how would I spend it?
- What truly matters, and what can I let go of?
- What am I postponing that would bring me peace or joy?

This perspective can sharpen our clarity. It can also soften us—making space for more presence and compassion.

If you’re reflecting here, you might also find meaning in [[Life Story & Personal Narrative]], [[Personal Philosophy of Life]], or [[Meditation & Mindfulness]]. Let those ideas enrich this practice.
