**Being vs Doing**

- **Definition:** "Doing" is about action and achievement, while "being" is about presence and self-awareness.
- **Importance:** Constant doing can lead to burnout. Balancing with moments of simply being can bring peace and clarity.
- **Tip:** Schedule time to reflect, meditate, or just be without any agenda.

**Key:** Living in the Present (Presence); Meditation & Mindfulness; Contentment in Life


- **Tip:** Schedule time each week to pause—whether that’s reflecting, meditating, or simply being still without any agenda.


Modern life often rewards doing—but without moments of being, it’s easy to burn out or feel disconnected from purpose.

Ask yourself:
- When do I feel like I’m just ‘doing’ to stay busy?
- What helps me reconnect with ‘being’?
- Where could I allow more stillness without guilt?

Balance isn’t about doing less—it’s about doing what matters from a grounded place of being.

This note pairs well with [[Simplicity & Essentialism]], [[Living in the Present (Presence)]], and [[Purposeful Leisure]] as ways to restore a sense of calm and clarity.
