### Identity and Life Roles

- Each person occupies multiple life roles (such as friend, parent, professional), and these roles collectively contribute to one’s overall identity.
- Sometimes conflicts arise when one role demands more time or when values in different roles clash, leading to stress or a sense of imbalance.
- Reflecting on your various roles and how you prioritize them can clarify your identity and ensure you allocate time in line with what matters most to you.

**Key:**
- Work-Life Balance
- Personal Philosophy of Life
- Life Story & Personal Narrative
- [[Personal Philosophy of Life]] and [[Journaling for Self-Reflection]] can support deeper integration.

Consider listing your current roles:
- Parent
- Sibling

Then reflect on how each role influences your identity, decisions, and energy. Which roles are expanding? Which are constricting?
