### Life Audit

- A life audit is a thorough and honest evaluation of various aspects of one's life (such as career, relationships, health, finances, and personal growth).
- The goal is to assess what’s going well and what isn’t, so you can identify areas that need change or more attention.
- Conducting a life audit periodically helps ensure your daily life aligns with your long-term values and goals, highlighting adjustments for greater fulfillment.

**Key:**
- Weekly Review Process
- Value Alignment in Life
- Personal Growth Plan

- [[Core Values Identification]] and [[Identity and Life Roles]] add deeper perspective to what matters and why.

These links make the audit more than just reflection—they make it transformational.


Consider evaluating:
- Health
- Relationships
- Work or purpose
- Creativity
- Personal growth
- Rest and play

Rate each on how satisfied you feel and why. Then ask: What’s missing? What’s working well? What small step would move this area forward?

This reflection connects naturally to [[Identity and Life Roles]], [[Bucket List Creation]], and [[Personal Growth Plan]]. It’s not about judging—it’s about seeing clearly so you can move forward with intention.
