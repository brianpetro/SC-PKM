### Bucket List Creation

- Creating a bucket list involves writing down all the experiences, goals, or achievements you want to accomplish in your lifetime.
- This exercise encourages you to dream big and consider what you find truly exciting or important before it’s too late.
- Regularly revisiting and acting on your bucket list can lead to a life rich with fulfilling experiences and fewer regrets.

**Key:**
- Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)
- Leaving a Legacy
- Meaningful Experiences
- [[Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)]] can add urgency, while [[Purposeful Leisure]] brings balance to the ambitions.

These links help the list become a deeper reflection of values and joy.


Think beyond travel. What experiences would leave you feeling deeply alive? What challenges would stretch you? What simple moments do you want more of?

Use prompts like:
- What have I always wanted to try?
- What would I regret not doing?
- Who do I want to share moments with?

When you're ready to go deeper, explore related reflections like [[Meaningful Experiences]], [[Life Vision & Goal Planning]], or [[Life Story & Personal Narrative]] for context and inspiration.

Update this list over time. Some items will fade, others will gain urgency. That’s part of the process—getting clearer on what really matters.

You can organize your list by themes if it helps:
- **Adventure**: See the Northern Lights, solo backpacking trip
- **Creative**: Write a short story, learn to paint
- **Relational**: Take a trip with each sibling, record family history
- **Growth**: Run a half marathon, attend a meditation retreat

Let this be a living note. Not just a dream list, but a nudge toward what gives your life color and shape.
