You don’t need a formula. Start with whatever’s on your mind. But if you need prompts, here are a few:
- What am I feeling right now?
- What’s been on my mind lately?
- What did I avoid today, and why?

Journaling can also become a grounding habit. A few minutes a day is enough to shift how you relate to yourself.

If this note resonates, explore [[Self-Inquiry Practices]] or [[Meditation & Mindfulness]] for deeper practices, and consider tying it into your [[Personal Growth Plan]] over time.
