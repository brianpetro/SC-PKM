### Journaling for Self-Reflection

- Journaling is the practice of writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences, which helps in reflecting on one's life and inner world.
- By regularly journaling, people can gain insights into their patterns, make sense of challenges, and recognize personal growth over time.
- It serves as a private space for honesty and introspection, often leading to greater self-awareness and emotional clarity.

You don’t need a formula. Start with whatever’s on your mind. But if you need prompts, here are a few:
- What am I feeling right now?
- What’s been on my mind lately?
- What did I avoid today, and why?

Journaling can also become a grounding habit. A few minutes a day is enough to shift how you relate to yourself.

If this note resonates, explore [[Self-Inquiry Practices]] or [[Meditation & Mindfulness]] for deeper practices, and consider tying it into your [[Personal Growth Plan]] over time.

**Overcoming an Existential Crisis**

- **Definition:** A phase of deep questioning about purpose, meaning, and one's place in the world.

- **Tip:** Explore philosophy, therapy, or spiritual perspectives to help reframe and rebuild meaning.

It’s not a breakdown—it’s a search. A chance to pause, question, and rebuild with more clarity.

Ask yourself:
- What assumptions about life or identity are being shaken?
- What values still feel solid beneath the uncertainty?
- What does this discomfort reveal about what I care about?

You don’t have to fix everything. Start with curiosity and self-compassion.

This note links well with [[Life Purpose Discovery]], [[Personal Philosophy of Life]], and [[Self-Transcendence]] as paths for rebuilding purpose and direction.

The process can be painful—but it’s also where deeper clarity begins.
