### Self-Inquiry Practices

- Self-inquiry is a process of questioning and examining one's own beliefs, fears, and motivations to gain deeper self-understanding.
- Methods like introspective questioning (e.g., asking “why do I feel this way?”) or frameworks like The Work of Byron Katie can challenge and dissolve negative thought patterns.
- Through persistent self-inquiry, individuals can break through mental barriers and uncover truths about what they genuinely want or who they are.

**Key:**
- Journaling for Self-Reflection
- Overcoming an Existential Crisis
- Meditation & Mindfulness

- [[Core Values Identification]] and [[Using Strengths and Talents]] could also deepen the self-awareness pathway.

These connections help shape a process of ongoing insight.


Here are a few questions to start with:
- What am I avoiding right now?
- What do I deeply want?
- When do I feel most like myself?
- What am I pretending not to know?

You can revisit these often—daily, weekly, or whenever you're stuck.

Pair this note with others like [[Journaling for Self-Reflection]] or [[Meditation & Mindfulness]] to help create space for deeper noticing. You might also see patterns emerge across entries in [[Meaningful Experiences]] or [[Identity and Life Roles]].
