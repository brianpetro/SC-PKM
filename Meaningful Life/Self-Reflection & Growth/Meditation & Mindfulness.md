- Meditation and mindfulness practices involve training one’s attention to stay in the present moment, observing thoughts and feelings without judgment.
- These practices can reduce stress and increase self-awareness by quieting the mind’s constant chatter and fostering a sense of calm and clarity.
- Over time, regular meditation can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and an improved ability to handle life’s ups and downs with equanimity.

These links bring clarity to why mindfulness matters.

You can practice mindfulness in many forms:
- Formal meditation (breath, body scan, etc.)
- Mindful walking
- Eating without distractions
- Checking in with your emotional state throughout the day

If meditation feels hard, try starting small. One minute of noticing your breath is enough to shift your attention.

This note can work alongside [[Self-Inquiry Practices]] or [[Meaningful Experiences]], especially when you're trying to understand your reactions or stay grounded during transitions.

You might also reflect here on how mindfulness shows up in different areas of your life: relationships, work, creativity, or stress management.
