### Using Strengths and Talents

- Everyone has unique strengths and talents – activities or skills that they naturally excel at or find energizing.
- Utilizing these strengths in work and personal life can lead to greater success and fulfillment, as tasks feel more engaging and less like a chore.
- Identifying your talents (through reflection or feedback) and finding ways to use them daily can significantly increase your sense of meaning and confidence.

**Key:**
- Personal Growth Plan
- Life Purpose Discovery
- Career vs Calling
- [[Identity and Life Roles]] and [[Core Values Identification]] would also help people explore how strengths align with who they are.

Think about the times when you felt "in flow" or naturally confident. What were you doing? Who were you helping? What kinds of problems were you solving?

Try listing out a few of your personal strengths. If you’re not sure where to start, think about compliments you’ve received, work you enjoy, or feedback that’s stuck with you.

Then ask yourself:
- How often do I get to use these?
- Are there ways I’m underusing them?
- Where could I bring them into new areas of life?

As you explore this, it might be helpful to check out [[Meaningful Experiences]] or [[Personal Growth Plan]] for ideas on how to apply your strengths more intentionally.
