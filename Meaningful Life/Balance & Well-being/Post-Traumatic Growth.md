**Post-Traumatic Growth**

- **Definition:** Positive psychological change that can arise from adversity or trauma.
- **Insight:** Challenges can deepen appreciation for life, improve relationships, or clarify priorities.
- **Tip:** Reflect on what a difficult experience taught you, and how you've grown from it.

**Key:** Resilience & Grit; Meaning in Suffering (Logotherapy); Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)


It doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means that through the struggle, new strengths or perspectives can emerge.

Ask yourself:
- What have I learned about myself through adversity?
- What values became clearer during or after the hardship?
- How has this experience changed the way I live or relate to others?

Growth doesn’t cancel out pain—but it can transform it.

This note pairs well with [[Resilience & Grit]], [[Memento Mori (Mortality Reminder)]], and [[Life Story & Personal Narrative]] for deeper reflection on strength through struggle.

- **Insight:** While the pain remains, growth from it can reveal inner strength, deeper purpose, or a renewed sense of life.
