**Purposeful Leisure**

- **Definition:** Engaging in restorative and enriching activities during your free time.
- **Examples:** Hobbies, nature walks, meaningful conversations, or creative work.
- **Tip:** Choose leisure that energizes and uplifts you—not just what’s easy or numbing.

**Key:** Time Affluence vs Money; Work-Life Integration; Flow State in Work


It’s not about escaping life—it’s about supporting it.

Ask yourself:
- What leisure activities bring real renewal?
- Where am I defaulting to passive distraction instead of active rest?
- How would my energy shift if I made leisure more intentional?

This note links well with [[Being vs Doing]], [[Simplicity & Essentialism]], and [[Living in the Present (Presence)]] for exploring how you recharge with meaning.

- **Tip:** Choose leisure that energizes and nourishes—not just what’s convenient or distracting.


Purposeful leisure is time that restores, inspires, or connects you with what matters.
