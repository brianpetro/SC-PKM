**Work-Life Integration**

- **Definition:** A flexible approach to balancing personal and professional roles by blending them together.
- **Benefit:** Encourages synergy rather than strict separation, making it easier to meet both work and life needs.
- **Tip:** Use time blocks for personal and professional tasks, and set boundaries that support both focus and flexibility.

**Key:** Work-Life Balance; Work-Life Integration; Personal Kanban Boards


Instead of rigid separation, it invites alignment: making sure work supports life, not competes with it.

Ask yourself:
- What’s one boundary I can soften or strengthen this week?
- Where do I feel most friction between work and life?
- What would more harmony actually look like for me?

Work-life integration is about blending—not balancing—how your personal and professional lives coexist.
