**Time Affluence vs Money**

- **Definition:** The comparison between having more discretionary time versus having more financial resources.
- **Insight:** Beyond a certain point, free time often contributes more to well-being than additional income.
- **Tip:** Evaluate life choices—are they bringing more money at the cost of time, or creating space for what matters?

**Key:** Simplicity & Essentialism; Work-Life Balance; Time Blocking


It’s easy to trade time for money. It’s harder to reclaim time as its own form of abundance.

Ask yourself:
- When do I feel most time-rich?
- Where am I overspending my time on things that don’t matter?
- What would it look like to protect white space in my week?

This note links well with [[Work-Life Integration]], [[Simplicity & Essentialism]], and [[Purposeful Leisure]].

Time affluence is the feeling of having enough time—just like financial wealth, but measured in presence and spaciousness.
