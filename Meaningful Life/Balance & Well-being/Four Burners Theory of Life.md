**Four Burners Theory of Life**

- **Definition:** A metaphor comparing life to a stove with four burners: family, friends, health, and work.
- **Idea:** You can’t turn all burners on high—excelling in one may require turning down another.
- **Tip:** Revisit your priorities regularly and be intentional about which burners you're fueling most.

**Key:** Work-Life Balance; Work-Life Integration; Time Affluence vs Money


To succeed, you often have to turn down one burner. To thrive, you may need to turn off two. It’s a model about tradeoffs—not because balance is impossible, but because energy is finite.

Ask yourself:
- Which burner have I been neglecting lately?
- Am I okay with that tradeoff right now?
- What small adjustment could help restore what matters?

There’s no perfect configuration. But being aware of your settings gives you more agency.

This note links naturally to [[Work-Life Integration]], [[Time Affluence vs Money]], and [[Life Audit]] for exploring how you prioritize energy and attention.

- **Idea:** You can’t keep all burners at full heat—choosing where to dial back is key to long-term balance.

To succeed, you often have to turn down one burner. To thrive, you may need to turn off two.

## HOW
### Felt problem, JTBD, and the dramatic question
- **Felt problem:** Trying to run all four burners on high leaves every area undercooked and you exhausted.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Help me choose which burner to dial back this season so the ones that matter most thrive."
- **Dramatic question:** Can I accept deliberate imbalance without feeling like I’m failing someone?
- **Stakes if unchanged:** Chronic guilt, health decline, and stalled relationships from spreading energy too thin.
- **Prize if this works:** Focused seasons where chosen burners flourish and tradeoffs feel intentional rather than reactive.

### Decisive choice, first principles, and boundaries
- **Decisive choice:** Pick one primary burner per quarter and consciously set supporting burners to medium or low.
- **First principles:** Energy is finite; attention compounds where it is invested; seasons create permission for rotation.
- **Method boundary:** One burner can be “high,” two “medium,” one “low,” reassessed during monthly reviews.
- **Tradeoffs:** Saying yes to a career push means scripting smaller rituals for family and health instead of winging them.
- **Success criteria:** Each burner has a stated priority level, a matching ritual, and a review note logging how it felt.

### Causal map and second and third order effects
- **Cause chain:** Prioritize → allocate rituals/time → communicate expectations → track energy → adjust burners.
- **Key levers:** Monthly burner review note and a shared calendar showing the chosen focus to collaborators or family.
- **Second-order wins:** Clear boundaries reduce resentment and make it easier to celebrate others’ seasons of focus.
- **Second-order risks:** Neglected burner can atrophy if "medium" rituals slip; review cadence prevents silent drift.
- **Measurable metrics:** Weekly energy rating per burner, number of intentional rituals kept, and satisfaction check-ins.

### Playbook, agency metrics, and stop conditions
- **Pattern name:** Seasonal Burner Rotation.
- **Minimal loop:** Decide burner priorities → script micro-rituals → log weekly reflections.
- **Checkable steps:** Record burner levels, schedule anchor rituals, debrief energy shifts each Sunday.
- **Stop conditions:** Pause or rebalance if two consecutive reviews show one burner below a 3/5 energy rating.
- **Definition of done:** Burners labeled, tradeoffs communicated, and next month’s adjustments documented.

### Visual and narrative execution plan
- **McKee beats:** Setup (overload), inciting choice (pick primary burner), rising tension (tradeoffs surface), climax (ritual realignment), resolution (energized focus).
- **Single visual metaphor:** Stove top animation with knobs turning to different intensities per season.
- **High-impact visuals:** Split-screen of calendar before/after prioritization and a dashboard showing burner energy scores.
- **Dramatization moments:** Montage of saying "not now" gracefully while spotlighting the chosen focus ritual in action.
- **Measured call to action:** Invite viewers to map their burner levels in Smart Vault and share one tradeoff they’re embracing.
