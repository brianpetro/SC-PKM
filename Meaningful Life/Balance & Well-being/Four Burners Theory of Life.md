**Four Burners Theory of Life**

- **Definition:** A metaphor comparing life to a stove with four burners: family, friends, health, and work.
- **Idea:** You can’t turn all burners on high—excelling in one may require turning down another.
- **Tip:** Revisit your priorities regularly and be intentional about which burners you're fueling most.

**Key:** Work-Life Balance; Work-Life Integration; Time Affluence vs Money


To succeed, you often have to turn down one burner. To thrive, you may need to turn off two. It’s a model about tradeoffs—not because balance is impossible, but because energy is finite.

Ask yourself:
- Which burner have I been neglecting lately?
- Am I okay with that tradeoff right now?
- What small adjustment could help restore what matters?

There’s no perfect configuration. But being aware of your settings gives you more agency.

This note links naturally to [[Work-Life Integration]], [[Time Affluence vs Money]], and [[Life Audit]] for exploring how you prioritize energy and attention.

- **Idea:** You can’t keep all burners at full heat—choosing where to dial back is key to long-term balance.
