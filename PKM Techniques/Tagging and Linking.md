## Effective Tagging Strategies
Use tags to categorize notes by topic, project, or theme. Consistent tagging enhances organization and searchability.

## Creating Meaningful Links
Links should be contextually relevant and help form a web of knowledge across different notes.

## Bidirectional Linking
Ensure that links between notes go both ways, allowing for easy navigation back and forth between related ideas.
