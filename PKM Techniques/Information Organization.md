## Hierarchical Organization
Organizes notes into layers using folders or headings, creating a tree-like structure.

## Networked Organization
Links notes together non-linearly, forming a web of ideas and connections.

## Tagging Systems
Tags categorize notes by topic or theme, making it easier to find related information across different areas.

## Folders vs. Tags
While folders create a rigid structure, tags allow for more flexibility in organizing and retrieving information.
